## 🐦 Notable Tweets

**@karpathy** — Epic thread on bespoke AI software:
> "The 'app store' of discrete apps you choose from is an increasingly outdated concept. The future are services of AI-native sensors & actuators orchestrated via LLM glue into highly custom, ephemeral apps."

Vibe coded a custom cardio dashboard by reverse-engineering his Woodway treadmill API. "This took 1 hour. It should take 1 minute."

**@MR_Derivatives** — Bullish SPX setup:
> "The last two times weekly Bollinger Bands were this tight, SPX broke out +15% in 16 weeks (2017, 2019). 2026's turn?"

Also noted QQQ's bizarre 8-day alternating red/green pattern. SPX has been green every Monday for 5 weeks straight.

**@levelsio** — Claude Code on servers:
> "Having each of your sites as a chat is such a logical idea. Message it errors, it fixes them. Message it features while at the gym."

Running Claude Code as daemon on Hetzner VPS, each site gets its own chat session via Telegram.

## 📅 Earnings & Economic Data

### Today
- **WMT Q4:** Beat on revenue ($190.7B, +5.6% YoY), EPS beat. BUT FY26 guidance missed ($2.75-2.85 vs $2.96 est). Stock -6.5% at open, dragged indices.

### After-Hours Watch
- Check @eWhispers for AH reporters — gold/silver miners were in focus this week (HL, CDE, PAAS, KGC, NEM)

### Upcoming
- **NVDA earnings Feb 25** — THE event. Will set the tone for AI capex narrative.
- **Core PCE Friday** — Fed's preferred inflation gauge

## 🔥 The Bottom Line

**Walmart's muted guidance** was the story — despite a solid Q4, FY26 EPS guidance of $2.75-2.85 missed the $2.96 consensus by a wide margin. Combined with Iran tensions pushing oil to 6-month highs, the market took profits on a 3-day win streak.

**The setup:** MR_Derivatives notes SPX Bollinger Bands at their tightest since 2019. Last two times this happened? +15% breakouts. NVDA earnings next week is the swing factor.

**Humanoid robots** are accelerating faster than expected. China at 90% market share, Unitree mass-shipping, Tesla pivoting Fremont capacity. This is the next NVDA-scale opportunity.
