# Anthropic Is Coming for Wall Street (And Everyone Else)

Four days ago, Anthropic launched Claude Code Security. Cybersecurity stocks cratered. CrowdStrike dropped 8%. Cloudflare tumbled. The market wiped out billions in a single session.

Today, they're back with round two.

## The Announcement That Shook Finance Twitter

This morning, Twitter user [@kimmonismus](https://x.com/kimmonismus) (known as "Chubby") posted what might be the understatement of 2026:

> "Anthropic is going to Investment Banking, this is nuts. Anthropic is currently destroying entire professions. The next domain to fall."

He was quote-tweeting [@Geiger_Capital](https://twitter.com/Geiger_Capital), who had the more alarming take:

> "*ANTHROPIC LINKS AI AGENT WITH TOOLS FOR INVESTMENT BANKING, HR*
> 
> It's over. Half of analyst seats will be gone in 5 years."

Is that hyperbole? Maybe. But the announcement is real, and it's extensive.

## What Anthropic Actually Launched

Anthropic unveiled 10 new plug-ins for their Claude Cowork platform, designed to automate knowledge work across:

- **Investment Banking**: Reviewing transaction documents, building comparable company analyses, preparing pitch materials
- **Private Equity**: Deal sourcing, document review, financial data extraction, scenario modeling
- **Wealth Management**: Portfolio analysis, drift identification, rebalancing recommendations at scale
- **Equity Research**: Parsing earnings transcripts, updating financial models, drafting research notes
- **Financial Analysis**: Market research, competitive analysis, financial modeling, PowerPoint generation
- **HR**: Offer letters, onboarding plans, performance reviews, compensation analyses
- **Engineering**: Standup summaries, incident response, deploy checklists, postmortems
- **Design**: Critique frameworks, UX copy, accessibility audits, user research plans
- **Operations**: Process documentation, vendor evaluations, change request tracking

They also announced integrations with FactSet, LSEG, S&P Global, Salesforce's Slack, DocuSign, Google Workspace, and more.

This isn't a demo. This isn't a research preview. These are production-ready enterprise tools with Fortune 500 partners already on board.

## The $830 Billion Question

Here's the number that should scare you: **$830 billion**.

That's how much Anthropic's recent AI releases have wiped from global software stocks over six trading days. Not a typo. Not cumulative over a year. Six days.

When Anthropic sneezes, entire industries catch pneumonia.

And it's not just fear. It's happening. Goldman Sachs has spent six months embedding Anthropic engineers directly within their teams to co-develop autonomous AI agents using Claude Opus 4.6. They're automating trade accounting, client onboarding, and compliance work—the bread and butter of junior Wall Street roles.

Marco Argenti, Goldman's CIO, put it plainly: "Think of it as a digital co-worker for many of the professions within the firm that are scaled, are complex, and very process intensive."

Translation: the work that junior analysts grind through at 2 AM is about to be done by Claude before lunch.

## The "It's Just a Tool" Copium

Anthropic's head of product, Scott White, called the market reaction "a little bit of an overreach or overreaction."

Sure. And the invention of the automobile was "a little bit of an overreach" for blacksmiths.

Here's the thing: these aren't theoretical capabilities. The plug-ins include concrete, domain-specific workflows:

- **Investment banking analysts** spend weeks building comp tables and combing through transaction documents. Claude can do it in hours.
- **Private equity associates** manually score opportunities against investment criteria. Claude automates the entire pipeline.
- **Equity researchers** read earnings transcripts and update models. Claude parses, extracts, and drafts the research note.

Goldman's Argenti admitted the firm could "cut out third-party providers" as AI matures. That's the polite corporate way of saying: vendors, your contracts are numbered.

## The Real Disruption Pattern

What we're witnessing isn't a single product launch—it's a systematic dismantling of the enterprise software stack.

The pattern is now clear:

1. **Anthropic launches domain-specific AI capability**
2. **Stocks of companies in that domain crater**
3. **Partner companies (who integrate with Claude) see their stocks rise**
4. **Everyone else scrambles to "add AI" before they're obsolete**

Last week it was cybersecurity. This week it's finance and HR. Next week? Legal is already in the crosshairs—Thomson Reuters is building a "purpose-built legal agent, reimagined from the ground up using the Claude Agent SDK."

The companies that survive will be those that become Claude accessories. Everyone else becomes a comp in Claude's analysis.

## "Half of Analyst Seats Gone in 5 Years"

Is Geiger_Capital's prediction realistic?

Consider:

- Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said the bank will "constrain headcount growth" as part of a multi-year AI overhaul
- Goldman's CIO was "surprised" at how capable Claude was beyond coding—especially in areas requiring parsing, rules, and judgment
- Investment banking already has brutal attrition; why backfill when Claude doesn't need sleep?

The 80-hour weeks that defined junior banking were always a feature, not a bug—a filter, a hazing ritual, proof of dedication. But when an AI can pull comps, format the deck, and triple-check the model by sunrise, what exactly are you proving by staying until 3 AM?

The honest answer: **half of analyst seats gone in five years might be optimistic**. Not because AI will do the work worse, but because it will do it cheaper, faster, and without the mental health crisis.

## What This Means for Everyone Else

If you're in finance, the message is clear: learn to work *with* Claude or compete *against* Claude. There is no third option.

If you're in software, the message is darker: every workflow you built is now a target. Anthropic isn't just building AI—they're building **AI that obsoletes your product category**.

If you're an enterprise software company, your survival depends on one question: can you become a Claude plug-in, or will Claude become your replacement?

## The Uncomfortable Truth

kimmonismus asked people to "take it with a grain of salt." But the reality is, there's nothing to doubt here. Bloomberg reported it. TechCrunch covered it. Anthropic published the blog post themselves.

This is happening.

Anthropic is valued at $380 billion. They have over 300,000 business customers. They're expected to go public. And with each product launch, they're not just capturing market share—they're **vaporizing market categories**.

The question isn't whether AI will transform knowledge work. That's settled.

The question is whether you're positioned to ride the wave or drown in it.
