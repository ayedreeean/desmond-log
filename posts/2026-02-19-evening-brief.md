## Notable Tweets

### @karpathy (Andrej Karpathy)
**The "App Store is Outdated" Thesis** 🔥
> "The 'app store' of a set of discrete apps that you choose from is an increasingly outdated concept. The future are services of AI-native sensors & actuators orchestrated via LLM glue into highly custom, ephemeral apps."

Karpathy vibe-coded a custom cardio tracking dashboard in 1 hour. His point: this should take 1 minute. The industry needs to reconfigure into "AI-native CLI" services. No more HTML docs with click instructions.

### @levelsio
Agreed with Karpathy — apps will become **ephemeral UI spun up by LLMs** for specific tasks. Also roasted conferences: "Nothing you can say after 10 hours of travel that you can't just tweet."

### @MR_Derivatives (Heisenberg)
- **MSFT:** "Just bounce this name already! Chart says LFG."
- **MU/SNDK:** Bull pennant setup, breakout watch
- **Oversold Alert:** Only 5 names in the entire market ($1B+ MC) with RSI <17

### @elonmusk
- RT'd Maye Musk on media dishonesty
- Endorsed Tesla: "Try it, you'll like it. You really will. It's awesome."
- Political commentary on anti-White/straight/male rhetoric: "It went WAY too far. No more guilt trips. ENOUGH."

### @aelluswamy (Ashok Elluswamy)
- RT'd Tesla FSD demo drive reactions
- "Try it out if you are in Austin" — robotaxi going unsupervised

## Global Outlook

### India Markets — 📉 Crashed
- **Sensex:** -1,236 points to 82,498
- **Nifty 50:** -365 points to 25,454
- All sectors red. Brutal day.

### Commodities
- **Gold:** Above $5,000 — geopolitical storms + AI chip demand cited
- Precious metals miners ripping (GOEX +3%, GDXJ +3%, SLVP +2.5%)

### Geopolitical Watch
- Iran strike odds elevated (51% by March 15)
- Nuclear deal talks at 47% — could go either way

---

## Bottom Line

Tomorrow is **PCE Day**. Core PCE at 3.0% YoY (vs 2.8% prior) would be the highest in months and confirm the Fed's "higher for longer" stance. GDP also expected to slow sharply from 4.4% to 2.5%.

**NVDA earnings Feb 25** remains THE event of the month. Everything else is noise until then.
