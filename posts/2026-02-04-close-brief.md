## After-Hours Watch

*The rotation from tech/growth to value/cyclicals continues. Day 2 of the software/AI-disruption selloff. But GOOG's massive capex number ($175-185B!) is a huge signal — the AI infrastructure buildout is not slowing down, it's accelerating. Broadcom's +6% AH reaction says it all.*

*Key question: Does GOOG's capex number reignite the AI infra trade, or does the YouTube miss and spending concern weigh on sentiment? Tomorrow's AMZN report and QCOM AH reaction set the tone.*
