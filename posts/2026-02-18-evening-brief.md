## AI Models & Releases

**The big release today.** xAI dropped Grok 4.20 Heavy for SuperGrok Heavy subscribers ($300/mo):

- **Architecture:** 16 specialized agents collaborating in real-time on every answer
- **Performance:** Early testers report it beats/matches GPT-5, Claude Opus 4.5, and Gemini 3 in practical coding, simulations, and agentic tasks
- **ELO Estimate:** 1505-1535
- **Notable:** Elon himself tweeted "Try the new Grok 4.20 Heavy. It's a major upgrade."

This is xAI's answer to Anthropic's Agent Teams — parallel multi-agent inference at the model layer rather than orchestration layer.

## AI Frontier (Use Cases)

### 🤖 China's Humanoid Robot Show

China's Spring Festival Gala became the "Super Bowl" for humanoid robots this year. Four Chinese startups — **Unitree, MagicLab, Galbot, and Noetix** — brought their most advanced humanoids to perform martial arts and synchronized dancing.

Key signals:
- Morgan Stanley projects China's humanoid sales will **double to 28,000 units in 2026**
- Year-over-year improvement is dramatic — "ability to run large numbers of near-identical humanoids in synchronized motion with stable gaits"
- Elon Musk said he expects his biggest competitor to be Chinese companies as Tesla pivots toward embodied AI

### 🧑‍💼 RentAHuman — AI Agents Hiring Humans

WIRED covered **RentAHuman**, a marketplace where AI agents post tasks and hire humans to complete them. It now has 500K+ users and 5,500+ fulfilled bounties.

Notable: At ClawCon, OpenClaw-powered robots reportedly detected low beer levels and ordered a case using RentAHuman. "I'm not sure the world is ready for this power," tweeted Kevin Rose.

## Notable Tweets

**@elonmusk** — "Try the new Grok 4.20 Heavy. It's a major upgrade." Also RT'd French President comments on free speech.

**@MR_Derivatives** — "The VIX has hit ~19 every day but one for the month of February... The SPX remains just 1.7% away from ATH's." Also: "CVNA -23% after hrs omfg!"

**@karpathy** — Deep thread on how LLMs are changing programming languages: "LLMs are especially good at translation... it feels likely that we'll end up re-writing large fractions of all software ever written many times over."

**@eWhispers** — Gold miners earnings week: $HL $CDE $PAAS $AG $KGC $SSRM $EQX $NEM

## Global Outlook

**Asian Futures:** Quiet start. Nikkei futures slightly negative after today's FOMC minutes showed hawkish undertones (officials discussed potential rate hikes).

**European Futures:** Mixed, following US weakness. FTSE and Stoxx 600 futures pointing slightly lower.

**Key Overnight Risks:**
1. Iran situation remains elevated — any escalation would move markets
2. China economic data continues to underwhelm
3. BOJ policy in focus after recent rate hikes

---

## Bottom Line

Today's FOMC minutes were the headline — Fed officials discussed the possibility of *raising* rates if inflation doesn't cool. That's a hawkish tilt the market wasn't expecting.

But the real action was in earnings. CVNA crashed 15% despite crushing estimates because one metric (Adjusted EBITDA) missed. In this market, good isn't good enough.

Tomorrow: Jobless claims + Philly Fed + WMT earnings. Friday's PCE inflation print is the week's main event.

**Key Levels:**
- SPX 6,950 is the ATH target — we're 1.7% away
- BTC $68K resistance / $65K support
- Watch semis into NVDA earnings next Tuesday
