## After-Hours Portfolio

SCOTUS tariff ruling relief rally continues into after-hours. Relatively quiet session as markets digest today's GDP/PCE data dump.

|--------|-------|-------------|------|
| **TSLA** | $411.82 | $411.25 | -0.14% |
| **GOOG** | $314.90 | $315.26 | +0.11% |

| **TXN** | $219.73 | $219.79 | +0.03% |
| **PLTR** | $135.24 | $134.52 | -0.53% |

**Notable moves today:**
- **GOOG +3.74%** — Led Mag 7 on SCOTUS tariff ruling striking down Trump trade tariffs
- **AAPL +1.54%** — Lifted by same ruling
- **TXN +0.77%** — YTD outperformance continues (+27.48%), $8.22B buyback announced
- **TSLA flat** — $59,990 Cybertruck announced (Elon RT'd)

**NVDA earnings Feb 25** remains THE event — expect volatility.

## Prediction Markets

**Geopolitics (major):**
- **US strikes Iran by Mar 15:** 53% (+2% today)
- **Iranian regime falls by 2027:** 40%
- **US-Iran nuclear deal before 2027:** 51%
- **Trump visits China by Mar 31:** 73%

**Fed & Policy:**
- **March Fed decision:** 95% no change, 5% cut (collapse from 15% cut odds pre-PCE)
- **Clarity Act signed 2026:** 71%
- **DHS shutdown 14+ days:** 95%

**AI Race:**
- **Best AI model end of Feb:** Anthropic 86%, Google 10%
- (OpenAI nowhere in sight)

**2028 Presidential:**
- JD Vance: 24%
- Gavin Newsom: 18%

---

## AI Models & Releases

**Anthropic dominance continues** — 86% Polymarket odds for best model at month end.

**Notable today:**
- **Dario Amodei at India AI Summit** warning that AI could surpass most human cognitive abilities within a "small number of years" (Mr_Derivatives flagged this)
- **Gemini 3.1 Pro** dropped yesterday with record benchmarks — but Google still only at 10% odds to lead
- **Tesla AI4 chip** — dual-computer redundancy for FSD (Elon RT'd)

No major new model drops today. The Feb 25 NVIDIA earnings will set the tone for AI infrastructure spend narrative.

## AI Frontier (Use Cases)

**Karpathy's Claw Thread** — Huge today:
> "Bought a new Mac mini to properly tinker with claws... I'm sus'd to run OpenClaw specifically — giving my private data/keys to 400K lines of vibe coded monster that is being actively attacked at scale is not very appealing... But I do love the concept."

He highlights **NanoClaw** as interesting (~4000 lines, containerized, config-via-skills pattern). Also praises "highly bespoke software" future — built a custom cardio tracker in 1 hour that would've been 10 hours 2 years ago.

**His thesis:** "The 'app store' of discrete apps you choose from is an increasingly outdated concept. The future are services of AI-native sensors & actuators orchestrated via LLM glue into highly custom, ephemeral apps."

**Levelsio agrees** — AI spinning up ephemeral interfaces "would probably be superior" to Airbnb's million-dollar design.

## Earnings Recap

**Today's notable reports:**
- **Oil States International** — Mixed Q4
- **Lamar Advertising** — In line
- **PPL** — In line (EPS $0.41 vs $0.41 est)

No major tech earnings today. Next week is packed.

- **ES (S&P 500):** 6,832.75 (-0.27%)
- **NQ (Nasdaq 100):** 24,699.00 (-0.28%)

Slightly soft but no major overnight moves.

### Key Overnight Themes:
- **Iran tensions:** Strike odds at 53% by mid-March, markets pricing in potential escalation
- **SCOTUS tariff ruling** — Relief rally may extend into Monday as tariff uncertainty lifts
- **NVDA earnings Wednesday** — Could move the entire AI complex

### Weekend Watch:
- Any Iran/Middle East developments
- China trade rhetoric (73% odds Trump visits by March)
- More AI model announcements (we're in a hot release window)

---

## The Bottom Line

**SCOTUS tariff ruling** gave us a relief rally (+0.6% S&P, +0.8% Nasdaq). But the economic data is concerning: **GDP way below estimates, Core PCE at 3.0%** means the Fed isn't cutting anytime soon (March cut odds now at 5%).

**Karpathy buying a Mac mini to tinker with Claws** is the kind of mainstream validation moment that matters. His security concerns are valid, but the concept is clearly capturing mindshare.

**NVDA earnings Wednesday** is the week's main event. Everything else is noise until then.
