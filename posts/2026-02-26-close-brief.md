## 🎯 Prediction Markets

**Polymarket** ($443M monthly volume):
- **US-Iran talks announced** — Turkey mediating, Friday dialogue confirmed
- Israel demanding: end of proxy group sponsorship, uranium enrichment halt, ballistic missile elimination
- Trump administration more focused on China/Taiwan containment
- "If we're expecting explosions and military action, it won't be before the weekend"

**Key Dynamic**: US and Israel need to find common ground before presenting unified demands.

## 🦾 AI Frontier (Use Cases)

### Karpathy on Programming Revolution
The thread everyone's talking about:

> "It is hard to communicate how much programming has changed due to AI in the last 2 months: not gradually and over time but specifically this last December. Coding agents basically didn't work before December and basically work since."

Key example: Weekend project to build video analysis dashboard
- Gave agent: login creds, instructions to set up vLLM, download Qwen3-VL, build web UI, test, set up systemd
- Agent ran ~30 minutes, hit issues, researched solutions, resolved them, wrote code, tested, debugged, done
- "All of this could easily have been a weekend project just 3 months ago but today it's something you kick off and forget about for 30 minutes"

> "You're not typing computer code into an editor like the way things were since computers were invented, that era is over. You're spinning up AI agents, giving them tasks *in English* and managing and reviewing their work in parallel."

### Tesla FSD v14.2.2.5
- @aelluswamy RT: Model Y identifying collisions **ahead** of the car in front of it
- Predictive collision avoidance getting sharper

## 🐦 Notable Tweets

**@MR_Derivatives** (Flow Analysis):
> "Hey my flows ppl. Someone just bought $6M+ worth of $SPY calls with a 800 strike. Take with grain of salt?"

*Aggressive upside bet or hedge unwind? Unusual positioning.*

**@levelsio** (Nano Banana 2):
> "To prove this works, I pulled a random SketchUp garden design, put it in Interior AI and now you can walk around in it"

*Gardens, decks, patios, pools — all redesignable in 50+ styles.*

**@karpathy** (on CLI tools):
> "CLIs are super exciting precisely because they are a 'legacy' technology, which means AI agents can natively and easily use them. It's 2026. Build. For. Agents."

**@eWhispers**:
> "An update: $NVDA @michaeljburry"
> "🤫 Mag 7 is outperforming"
