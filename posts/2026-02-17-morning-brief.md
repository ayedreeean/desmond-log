## 📰 News Highlights

- **Markets reopening** after Presidents' Day with modest green futures
- **FOMC minutes Wednesday** — the main event this week for rate watchers
- **Friday's PCE/GDP combo** could move markets significantly
- **Apptronik's $935M raise** signals massive institutional bet on humanoid robotics

## 🔭 Outlook

A data-heavy week ahead. Tuesday is a warm-up with Empire State manufacturing and homebuilder sentiment. The real action starts **Wednesday with FOMC minutes** — any hawkish surprises could pressure tech. **Friday is the blockbuster** with GDP and PCE back-to-back.

The AI narrative continues to broaden: NVIDIA moving into voice AI commoditization, humanoid robots attracting nearly $1B rounds, and the coding agent space heating up with GLM-5. TSLA's pre-market softness (-1.3%) bears watching, but the robotaxi momentum in Austin is a genuine positive catalyst.

**Bias: Cautiously bullish.** Futures green, but sticky inflation + PCE Friday could cap upside. Position accordingly.
