## Prediction Markets

- **Government shutdown**: Kalshi still trading elevated odds as funding deadline approaches
- **Fed rate decisions**: Markets pricing cuts later in 2026 after CPI came in at 2.4% YoY (below 2.5% est) on Friday — dovish signal
- **New Zealand** became the first country to declare Polymarket and Kalshi illegal, calling them gambling platforms — regulatory headwinds for prediction markets globally

## AI Models & Releases

### NVIDIA PersonaPlex-7B
The big drop today: NVIDIA's open-source **full-duplex conversational AI** model. Collapses the entire ASR→LLM→TTS pipeline into a single 7B-parameter transformer.
- **170ms turn-taking latency**, 240ms interrupt handling
- Runs on a single A100
- Open weights, permissive commercial license
- This commoditizes the voice AI API stack — bad for ElevenLabs/Deepgram/Assembly margins, great for builders

### Karpathy: GPT in 200 Lines
Andrej Karpathy published GPT training + inference in **200 lines of pure, dependency-free Python**. Also posted a thoughtful thread on how LLMs change the programming languages landscape — translation vs. de-novo generation, and why we'll rewrite large fractions of all software many times over.

## AI Frontier (Use Cases)

### X-Humanoid Tien Kung 3.0 (China)
Beijing Innovation Center launched **Embodied Tien Kung 3.0** — a general-purpose humanoid platform with:
- High-torque joints, millimeter-level calibration
- Perception→decision→execution AI loop
- Multi-robot collaboration for industrial use

### AgiBOT Expedition A3
Chinese humanoid doing martial arts in demo videos. End-to-end AI model powers wake-word-free conversation and shoulder-tap activation. Mass production planned for 2026 with 5,100+ units projected.

### Qualcomm Robotics Stack
Showcased full robotics technology stack at India AI Impact Summit — pushing Snapdragon into edge robotics.

### AI Movies
The Dor Brothers claim to have made a "$200M AI movie in one day" — 100% AI-generated. The creative tools frontier keeps accelerating.

The FOMC minutes (Wed) and PCE data (Fri) are the week's headline events. After Friday's soft CPI print (2.4% vs 2.5% est), markets will parse the minutes for any shift in cut timing.
