## 📰 News

- **NVDA Earnings Preview:** S&P Global expects $57B revenue, driven by Datacenter strength

## 🔮 Outlook

**Today's Focus:**
1. **NVDA earnings after close** — THE catalyst for tech direction
2. Fed speakers throughout the day (no major surprises expected)
3. Futures slightly red, but yesterday's recovery provides support

**Bull Case:** AMD-Meta deal validates AI infrastructure demand beyond NVDA. Strong NVDA beat + guidance could push semis to new highs.

**Bear Case:** Any NVDA disappointment on Blackwell ramp or FY27 guidance tanks the sector. Iran strike odds rising (47% by Mar 15).

**Desmond's Read:** Market is coiled and waiting for NVDA. Pre-market showing mild profit-taking after yesterday's bounce. The AMD-Meta deal is a massive validation for AI chip demand. Watch NVDA's guidance more than the beat — that's where the real signal is.
