## After-Hours Portfolio

The "sell the news" pattern continues after yesterday's NVDA earnings monster beat.

| Ticker | Close | After-Hours | Day Δ | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------------|-------|-------|
| **TSLA** | $408.58 | $406.71 | -2.10% | 18.5% off ATH, range: $403.66-416.80 |
| **NVDA** | $189.82 | ~$190 | +0.14% | Beat faded, 13% off ATH |
| **TXN** | — | — | — | YTD leader still intact |
| **PLTR** | — | — | — | Consolidating |
| **AMD** | — | — | -1.5% | Soft on NVDA sympathy |
| **GOOG** | — | — | — | 12% off ATH |
| **AAPL** | — | — | — | 5.5% off ATH, product launch tease |

**Heisenberg's observation:** SPY is just 1.5% from ATH while MSFT is 29% off, AMZN 20% off, META 18% off, TSLA 18.5% off. Rotation, but the concentration risk is real.

**Key movers AH:**
- **Block (XYZ)** +22-25% — Jack Dorsey cutting 40% of staff (4,000 jobs) to go "AI-native"
- **CoreWeave (CRWV)** -10% — Hyperscaler concerns
- **Duolingo** dragging futures per Heisenberg

## Crypto Pulse

| Asset | Price | 24h Δ | Notes |

| **ETH** | $2,069 | +8.1% | Still struggling to hold $2K |
| **SOL** | $78-86 | Weak | Lost $88 support, back in old range |

Crypto bounced but bulls face long odds ahead of Friday's PPI data. SOL is the weakest major — slipped back into its previous trading range after losing $88 support.

## AI Frontier (Use Cases)

**🤖 Humanoid Robot Race:**

| Company | Robot | Target | Notes |
|---------|-------|--------|-------|

Market could reach **$200B by 2035**. The race for physical AI is heating up.

**🧠 Karpathy's Viral Thread:**
> "It is hard to communicate how much programming has changed due to AI in the last 2 months: not gradually and over time in the 'progress as usual' way, but specifically this last December... coding agents basically didn't work before December and basically work since."

He describes setting up a full video analysis dashboard for his home cameras by giving an agent a natural language prompt — "went off for ~30 minutes, ran into multiple issues, researched solutions online, resolved them one by one... and it was just done."

> "Programming is becoming unrecognizable. You're not typing computer code into an editor like the way things were since computers were invented, that era is over."

## Notable Tweets

**🚀 @elonmusk**
> "Starship V3 SN1 headed for ground tests. I am highly confident that the V3 design will achieve full reusability."

SpaceX milestone: First Starship V3 left the build site for prelaunch testing. Also noted Grok 4.20 is "getting good at engineering."

**🧠 @karpathy**
Historic thread on AI coding transformation:
> "Over the weekend I was building a local video analysis dashboard... wrote: 'Here is the local IP and username/password of my DGX Spark. Log in, set up ssh keys, set up vLLM, download and bench Qwen3-VL, set up a server endpoint...' The agent went off for ~30 minutes... and it was just done. I didn't touch anything."

Also bullish on CLIs as "legacy" tech that agents can natively use: "It's 2026. Build. For. Agents."

**📊 @Mr_Derivatives (Heisenberg)**
- "Last three Fridays we had VIX Crush Fridays. No waaaaay they do it again tomorrow, right!?"
- Noted $NFLX hit $95 and the Mag 7 concentration paradox

## Global Outlook

**🇮🇷 Iran Talks:**
- US-Iran negotiations mediated by Turkey announced for Friday
- Oil erased early gains on progress signs
- Key tension: Israel's demands vs Trump admin's China focus

**🌏 Futures Positioning:**
- Bonds climbing as risk sentiment moderates
- Oil fading on Iran progress
- Asian session watching PPI reaction

**🌍 Geopolitical Watch:**
- Pentagon-Anthropic AI negotiations at deadline
- The military AI access debate intensifies

---

## Bottom Line

The Block earnings are the story tonight — **40% layoffs to go AI-native, stock rips 25%**. The market is telling you exactly how it views AI transformation: cut humans, replace with AI, get rewarded.

NVDA's beat continues to fade as "sell the news" dominates. Karpathy's viral thread captures the moment: "That era is over." The Mag 7 dispersion (down 12-29% from ATHs while SPY is 1.5% from ATH) suggests rotation, not collapse.

Tomorrow's PPI is the gatekeeper for Friday's sentiment. Heisenberg watching for a fourth VIX Crush Friday. Stay nimble.
