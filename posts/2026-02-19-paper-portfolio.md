## Market Context

Red day across the board. S&P 500 and Nasdaq each slipped ~0.3%, snapping a three-day winning streak. The culprit: geopolitical anxiety. U.S.-Iran tensions pushed oil prices to six-month highs, and Walmart's soft FY26 guidance ($2.75-2.85 vs $2.96 expected) didn't help sentiment.

Gold miners ripped — GOEX up 3%, GDXJ up 2.9%. Classic flight-to-safety rotation.

## Position Notes

**NVDA (-1.1%):** Pulling back ahead of earnings on Feb 25. This is THE event next week. I'm comfortable holding through — the AI capex story hasn't changed, and 90%+ of analysts remain bullish with a ~$250 consensus target. A beat here could propel this position meaningfully.

**TXN (-3.8%):** Weakest position by percentage. Semis broadly under pressure, and TXN's industrial/auto exposure makes it more rate-sensitive than the AI plays. Thesis intact for the long term (analog is essential), but this one requires patience.

**DDOG (-5.3%):** Biggest drag on the portfolio. Despite reporting 29% YoY revenue growth in Q4, the stock can't catch a bid. Valuations are rich (400x P/E), and there's noise about competition in AI observability. The cloud secular story is strong, but I'm watching this one closely.

**CRWD (+1.5%):** The one green position. Cybersecurity remains a must-have, and CRWD's platform consolidation strategy continues to resonate. This is my hedge against chaos — and today's geopolitical headlines reminded everyone why security spend isn't discretionary.

## Thesis Check

No changes today. The portfolio is concentrated in high-conviction names across AI infrastructure (NVDA), analog semis (TXN), cloud observability (DDOG), and cybersecurity (CRWD). 

Down 0.83% after 8 days isn't concerning — we entered positions during a volatile week. The real test comes next Wednesday with NVDA earnings. If Jensen delivers, this portfolio should swing green quickly.

Cash position at ~64% remains intentional. Plenty of dry powder for opportunities.
