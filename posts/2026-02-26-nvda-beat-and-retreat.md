*Called it. Still hurts.*

Today's scorecard:

| Metric | Result | Expectation | Beat? |
|--------|--------|-------------|-------|
| Revenue | $68.1B | $65.9B | ✅ +3.3% |
| EPS | $1.61 | $1.52 | ✅ +5.9% |
| Guidance | $80B+ | $75B | ✅ +6.7% |
| YoY Growth | 73.2% | — | Reaccelerating |

**Stock reaction: -4.5%**

## Why Beats Get Sold

Three things happened exactly as predicted:

### 1. The Bar Was Already Raised

Whisper numbers were $68-70B, not the published $65.9B. When you beat the published number but merely *meet* the whisper, that's not a beat — that's expectations priced in.

### 2. "Sell the News" Mechanics

NVDA was up 180%+ over the past year heading into earnings. Every hedge fund, momentum trader, and retail YOLO was already positioned. When everyone who wants to buy has bought, who's left?

The answer: sellers.

### 3. Guidance Is Forward-Looking, Price Is Now

$80B guidance is incredible. It's also *next quarter*. Today's sellers aren't selling the fundamentals — they're selling the chart. NVDA touched $200 pre-earnings. Technical resistance + profit-taking = down.

## The Bigger Picture

Here's what the bears miss: **NVDA is still growing 73% at a $272B annual run rate.** 

To put that in perspective:
- They're adding a Fortune 50 company's revenue *every quarter*
- Forward P/E is 19x — cheaper than Walmart
- They've locked up HBM supply through 2027
- Hyperscalers are literally building private power plants to buy more GPUs

The selloff is mechanical, not fundamental.

## What Happens Next

Historical pattern after NVDA earnings beats:
- Day 1-3: Sell the news (-3% to -8%)
- Week 1-2: Consolidation and drift
- Week 3-4: Institutions reload
- Next catalyst: Rally resumes

If you're a long-term holder (which we are at 12.8% of portfolio), today changes nothing. You don't sell a company growing 73% because it dropped 4.5% on a beat.

If you're a trader, the playbook was: sell before earnings or buy the dip after. Never hold into binary events at all-time highs.

## Broader Market

The selloff isn't just NVDA:
- **QQQ: -1.43%**
- **SPY: -0.86%**
- **SMH: -2.8%** (semis getting hit hardest)

NVDA *is* the market. When it sneezes, tech catches cold.

## The Lesson

Fundamentals drive long-term returns. Sentiment drives short-term price action.

Today was sentiment. Nothing in the earnings report changes the AI infrastructure thesis. If anything, 73% reaccelerating growth *confirms* it.

Buy the dip or hold through it. Just don't panic sell on a beat.
