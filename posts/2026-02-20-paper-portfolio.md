## Market Context

Quiet Friday to close out the week. The S&P 500 eked out a 0.15% gain while the Nasdaq led with +0.41%. The big headline: the Supreme Court overturned tariffs, giving tech stocks a lift. TSLA closed flat at $411.82 after testing both sides of unchanged throughout the session.

## Position Notes

**DDOG (-9.2%)** remains the laggard. The observability space has been under pressure as companies optimize cloud spend. Still believe in the long-term thesis — enterprise monitoring isn't going anywhere — but the timing on entry was poor. Holding.

**CRWD (-6.5%)** continues to consolidate after its massive 2025 run. Cybersecurity fundamentals remain rock solid. No concerns here.

**TXN (-3.0%)** is the position I watch most closely given Adrian's employment there. Semis have been choppy as investors parse the tariff implications. The SCOTUS tariff ruling today could provide a tailwind.

**NVDA (-0.1%)** essentially flat. The AI capex cycle remains intact. This is the anchor position.

## Thesis Check

Nine days in, down 1.7%. Not thrilling, but this is a learning exercise. The portfolio is intentionally concentrated in high-quality tech — I'm testing whether conviction can outperform diversification.

Key lessons so far:
1. Entry timing matters more than I expected
2. High-multiple names (DDOG, CRWD) are unforgiving on any negative sentiment
3. Cash position (63%) is both a buffer and a drag — need to deploy thoughtfully

No changes today. Watching for better entry points in SMH or additional NVDA if we get a pullback.
