## AI Models & Releases

**The Week in AI:**

- **Karpathy's 1-Year Vibe Coding Retrospective**: Coined the term "agentic engineering" to describe the evolved professional workflow — orchestrating agents with oversight rather than raw vibe coding for production
- **GPT-2 for $20**: Karpathy's nanochat now trains GPT-2 in 2.91 hours on 8xH100 (~$20 at spot prices) with fp8 training. That's a **600x cost reduction** over 7 years
- **Claude Opus 4.6**: Still fresh from last week's release with Agent Teams capability
- **Claude 5 Watch**: 12% Polymarket odds for release by Feb 28
- **levelsio's Conspiracy**: "AI companies nerf models to save on compute, then check X to see if anyone notices"

## AI Frontier (Use Cases)

**Robotics & Autonomy:**
- **Tesla Robotaxi**: Fully unsupervised rides now live in Austin. @aelluswamy sharing user videos, encouraging Austin residents to try it
- **SpaceX Moon Travel**: Elon announced SpaceX will build a system allowing "anyone to travel to Moon" — reiterating Mars ambitions alongside

**Developer Tooling:**
- levelsio notes AI now does all his coding: "my daily accomplishments are more like 'wow great job managing' than coding"
- The "prompt factory" meme is real — management layer on top of AI execution

## Notable Tweets

**@elonmusk** — SpaceX excitement:
> "SpaceX will build a system that allows anyone to travel to Moon. This will so insanely cool 🚀💫🤩"
> 
> "Life cannot just be about one sad thing after another. There must also be things that make us super excited and inspired about the future."

**@karpathy** — Vibe coding anniversary:
> "The one thing I'd add is that at the time, LLM capability was low enough that you'd mostly use vibe coding for fun throwaway projects... Today (1 year later), programming via LLM agents is increasingly becoming a default workflow for professionals"
> 
> Coined "agentic engineering" — orchestrating agents with oversight, distinct from pure vibe coding.

**@Mr_Derivatives** — Market structure:
> "$SPY has been trading in a tight trading range for the last 4 months. Bollinger Bands one of the tightest in several years. Something. Has. To. Give…"
>
> Still expecting a 5% dip to fill the 6,603 SPX gap.

**@levelsio** — AI coding reality:
> "It feels like my daily accomplishments are more like 'wow great job managing' than coding like before"
> 
> Also suspects models are being nerfed to save compute.

**@aelluswamy** — Tesla Autopilot VP:
> "Try it out if you are in Austin." (on unsupervised robotaxi rides)

## Global Outlook

**Overnight Setup:**
- Asian markets closed mixed — Nikkei futures flat, Hang Seng under pressure from China property concerns
- European futures pointing slightly higher
- Dollar strength persists on Fed hold expectations
- Gold continues rally (+2.5% today) as shutdown/geopolitical hedges

**Geopolitical Watch:**
- Iran strike odds creeping up on Polymarket (17% by Feb 20)
- UK's Starmer facing pressure — 35% odds out by March 31

---

## Bottom Line

Another green day for semis and the broader market, but we're in a tight range. MR_Derivatives is right — something has to give. The 10-month winning streak is long in the tooth.

**This week's catalysts:**
1. **CPI Friday** — the main event. Consensus 2.5% YoY core
2. **Shutdown drama** — 64% odds we hit another impasse by Feb 14
3. **Big earnings** — HOOD, COIN, SHOP, ANET could move sectors
4. **Fed speakers** — Hammack and Logan tomorrow, watching for any pivot signals

Crypto weak, AI strong, semis leading. Classic risk-on with a side of uncertainty.
