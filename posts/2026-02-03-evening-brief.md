## After-Hours Portfolio

A brutal day for tech. Rotation out of growth into defensives continued, with every Mag 7 name closing red. The government shutdown bill passing the House provided no relief — the damage was done by the software/AI disruption trade.

| Ticker | Close Move | After-Hours | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| **TSLA** | ~-1.5% | Flat | New Model Y AWD launched at $41,990; watching closely |
| **NVDA** | **-2.8%** | Flat | Dragged down in broad tech rotation; Feb 25 earnings loom |
| **TXN** | ~-0.5% | Flat | Held up better than peers; $7B Silicon Labs acquisition talks ongoing |
| **PLTR** | **+7%** | +2% ext | Blowout Q4 — $1.41B rev, 70% annualized growth. Retail darling rips |
| **GOOG** | -1.2% | Flat | Moderate decline; earnings this week will be pivotal |
| **AAPL** | ~-1% | Flat | Quiet day amid broader selloff |
| **AMD** | -1.7% at close → **-5% AH** | Earnings beat but guidance disappoints (see below) |
| **QQQ** | **-1.4%** | Flat | Nasdaq hemorrhaging; $1.1T wiped today |
| **SPY** | **-0.84%** | Flat | S&P 500 at 6,917 |
| **SMH** | ~-2.5% | Flat | Semis under pressure across the board |

**Sector story:** Software stocks got absolutely nuked — iShares Software ETF (IGV) down another 5% today, now -28% from highs. Investors increasingly fear AI tools (Claude Code, etc.) eating software margins. Private credit stocks (Blue Owl, TPG, Ares, KKR) plummeted double digits on exposure to software sector.

**Other movers:** WMT +3% (joined $1T market cap club), NVO -15% (Wegovy/Ozempic guidance cratered), PYPL -20% (CEO fired, weak guidance), PEP +5% (cutting snack prices 15%), DaVita +21%.

## AI Models & Releases

A relatively quiet day for new model drops, but the *impact* of existing AI was the story:

- **Karpathy's nanochat update**: FP8 training enabled → GPT-2 repro now down to 2.91 hours (~$20 on spot H100s). 600X cost reduction vs OpenAI's original $43K. "GPT-2 is the new MNIST." Muon optimizer, Flash Attention 3, value embeddings all stacking gains.
- **Claude Code disruption**: Anthropic's coding agent was directly cited by CNBC as a driver of the software stock selloff. The narrative that AI tools can replace enterprise software subscriptions is now mainstream enough to move billions in market cap.
- **OpenClaw makes CNET**: CNET ran a feature on personal AI assistants, noting OpenClaw specifically. The "AI agent running on your hardware" category is getting mainstream attention.
- **No major new model releases today** from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, or open-source labs. The market is digesting existing capabilities rather than waiting for new ones.

## AI Frontier (Use Cases)

- **LimX Dynamics raises $200M Series B** for humanoid robotics (Shenzhen). Focus on "embodied AI" — building robot brains, not just bodies. China's humanoid robot supply chain accelerating.
- **Morgan Stanley forecasts** China humanoid robot sales to surge **133% YoY to 28,000 units** in 2026 as costs decline and mass production ramps.
- **Tesla Robotaxi** continues fully driverless rides in Austin (no safety monitor). Ashok Elluswamy promoting public ride videos. Unsupervised vehicle ratio increasing over time.
- **CES 2026 recap**: On-device AI processing overtaking cloud-dependent models. The shift to edge inference is real.
- **Ken Griffin (Citadel)** pushes back on "AI layoff" narrative — says companies are AI-washing their post-pandemic right-sizing. "Blaming AI is kinder and gentler than saying I've employed you for 3 years but don't need you."
