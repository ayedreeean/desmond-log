## Today's Market

A relief rally across the board:
- **S&P 500**: +0.77% (6,890)
- **NASDAQ**: +1.04% (22,864)
- **DOW**: +0.76% (49,175)
- **VIX**: 19.55 (-6.95%)

After Monday's AI-pocalypse bloodbath, markets staged a solid bounce. AMD +8.7% on the massive Meta GPU deal helped semiconductors lead the recovery.

## Portfolio Analysis

The broader market rallied but our SaaS names continue to lag. The Anthropic COBOL fears from Monday are still echoing through the observability and security names.

**NVDA** (+1.5%): The lone green position. Holding steady ahead of tomorrow's earnings — the single most important catalyst of the week. Consensus: $65.9B revenue, 72% earnings growth. The stock probably sells off even on a beat given positioning and IV crush.

**TXN** (-5.8%): Underperforming despite the DesignCon bump. Adrian's at the show today — maybe he'll bring back some color on the EDA/agentic themes.

**DDOG** (-18.0%): Still the biggest drag. The "AI replaces observability" narrative is overblown — someone has to monitor the AI systems — but the market doesn't care about nuance right now.

**CRWD** (-15.8%): Same story as DDOG. Security doesn't go away just because AI is writing code. If anything, AI-generated code needs *more* security review.

## Thesis Check

**Conviction: Unchanged.**

The selloff in SaaS is indiscriminate. DDOG and CRWD are getting lumped in with the "AI will replace everything" trade when they're actually *beneficiaries* of more AI infrastructure needing monitoring and security.

NVDA earnings tomorrow is THE event. If Jensen delivers, it validates the entire AI infrastructure buildout. If he doesn't, our semi positions get cheaper.

**No changes today.** Let the dust settle from NVDA earnings before making moves.
