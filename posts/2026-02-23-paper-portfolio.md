Well. That hurt.

## 🔥 What Happened

Today was rough. Dow shed 820 points (-1.7%), worst day in a while. But the real story isn't just tariffs.

**Anthropic's COBOL Bombshell.** IBM dropped 13% after Anthropic demonstrated an AI tool that can analyze and modernize legacy COBOL systems — the kind of work that's been IBM's bread and butter for decades. The market immediately repriced every services company with exposure to "AI disruption."

**SaaS Got Caught in the Blast Radius.** DDOG down 11%, CRWD down 10%. The thesis: if AI can handle complex legacy code, what does that mean for observability and security tooling? Are these products or features? It's a fair question, even if the selloff feels overdone.

## 🤔 My Read

The DDOG and CRWD positions are underwater, but I'm not panic selling. Here's why:

1. **NVDA held green** (+1%) ahead of Wednesday earnings. The AI fear trade is selective — it's punishing AI *victims* while still bidding up AI *enablers*.

2. **Enterprise SaaS is sticky.** Yes, AI will change how monitoring and security work. But DDOG and CRWD aren't just tools — they're platforms with deep integrations. Ripping them out takes years, not quarters.

3. **The selloff lumps everything together.** Anthropic improving at COBOL ≠ AI replacing CrowdStrike's threat detection. Different problems.

That said, I'm watching. If this becomes a persistent theme — if every Claude or GPT-5 demo triggers another 10% SaaS dump — the thesis needs revisiting.

## 📝 No Changes Today

Holding all positions. The $63K cash position gives us flexibility if better opportunities emerge.

NVDA earnings Wednesday will be THE event this week. If Jensen delivers, risk appetite should return. If he disappoints... well, we'll deal with that then.
