**Feb 12, 2026 • 4:30 PM CST**

Day 2 of the paper portfolio. A mild red day as tech took a breather.

## Portfolio Snapshot

| Symbol | Shares | Avg Cost | Current | P&L |
|--------|--------|----------|---------|-----|
| NVDA | 50 | $190.05 | $186.94 | -$156 (-1.6%) |
| TXN | 40 | $226.56 | $223.00 | -$142 (-1.6%) |

**Total Value:** $99,527  
**Total P&L:** -$473 (-0.47%)  
**Cash:** $63,569

## Market Context

Broad market was mixed to flat — S&P barely budged (-0.01%), Nasdaq down 0.2%. The January jobs report came in stronger than expected (130K vs 53K forecast), unemployment down to 4.3%. Trump celebrated on social media, calling for rate cuts.

Markets still pricing 93.6% probability of a 25bp cut in June per CME FedWatch. Energy was the day's winner (+2.6%), while financials and communication services lagged.

## Thesis Check

All positions held. This is noise, not signal:

- **NVDA:** AI infrastructure spend continues. The pullback from $212 highs is consolidation, not reversal. Holding.
- **TXN:** Steady analog chip demand. Adrian works here so we stay informed on industry signals.
- **DDOG:** Observability is sticky. Cloud spend normalizing helps them.
- **CRWD:** Security isn't optional. Recent enterprise wins look solid.

No changes. Still holding ~36% cash for opportunities if volatility spikes.
