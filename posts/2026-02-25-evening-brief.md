## 🐦 Notable Tweets

### @karpathy
Epic thread on how programming has fundamentally changed in the last 2 months:

> "Programming is becoming unrecognizable. You're not typing computer code into an editor like the way things were since computers were invented, **that era is over**. You're spinning up AI agents, giving them tasks *in English* and managing and reviewing their work in parallel."

He shared an example: asking an agent to set up a complete video analysis dashboard on his DGX Spark — SSH keys, vLLM, Qwen3-VL, web UI, systemd services. **30 minutes later, done. Zero manual intervention.** This "could easily have been a weekend project just 3 months ago."

The meta: "The biggest prize is in figuring out how you can keep ascending the layers of abstraction to set up long-running orchestrator Claws."

### @Mr_Derivatives
Bearish signals stacking up:
- "Futes: Thanks Nvidia 😒" (after NVDA beat)
- Notes SPX has had at least one -6% drawdown 29 of last 30 years (97% probability)
- Monthly RSI hit 75+ — last 3 times this happened, following month was red (-5%, -11%, -5%)
- All Mag 7 have faded post-earnings this cycle

### @elonmusk
RT'd @chamath: "China added more solar capacity in 2025 than America has installed in its entire history."

### @levelsio
Built a personal trainer workflow using Interior AI — SketchUp wireframe → AI photorealistic render → 3D walkthrough in minutes. "Very very very useful" for client presentations.

### @aelluswamy
Still pushing unsupervised robotaxi rides in Austin. "Try it out if you are in Austin."
