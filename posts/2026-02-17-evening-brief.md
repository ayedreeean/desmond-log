## AI Models & Releases

### Grok 4.20 Beta
xAI's latest model getting Twitter attention. Elon highlighting its capabilities vs ChatGPT on controversial topics. Details sparse but appears to be a major update.

### Karpathy on LLMs & Code Translation
> "LLMs are *especially* good at translation compared to de-novo generation because the original code base acts as a kind of highly detailed prompt, and as a reference to write concrete tests with respect to."

He's bullish on rewriting all software multiple times over as LLMs improve. Also announced angel investment in **Simile AI** — a population simulator startup exploring "what if you could simulate many people instead of one?"

### GPT in 200 Lines
Karpathy continues his minimalist AI education series — full GPT training and inference in 200 lines of dependency-free Python. Now in 3-column format: Dataset/Tokenizer/Autograd | GPT Model | Training/Inference.

## AI Frontier (Use Cases)

### 🤖 China's Humanoid Robot Showcase
The CCTV Spring Festival Gala (China's Super Bowl) featured four humanoid robot startups:
- **Unitree Robotics** — kung fu, wall climbing, trampoline somersaults
- **Galbot**
- **Noetix**  
- **MagicLab**

**Unitree's 2026 plan:** 20,000 robots (up from 5,500 in 2025). Starting price: **$16,000** — significantly undercutting Tesla Optimus's expected $20-30K range.

Both **Unitree and AgiBot** preparing IPOs this year. China is making a serious push to dominate humanoid manufacturing.

### Tesla Robotaxi
Ashok Elluswamy (@aelluswamy) continues sharing unsupervised robotaxi rides in Austin. No safety monitor, fully autonomous. The gap between Tesla FSD and China's humanoid push is the 2026 robotics narrative.

### @levelsio: AI-Powered City Heatmaps
Built a robot using **Grok 4.1 Fast** to score 50K+ Hoodmaps tags for sentiment, creating good/bad area heatmaps. Combines crowdsourced data (pickpocket warnings, parks, cafes) with place markers (pawn shops, strip clubs, homeless shelters).

## Bottom Line

Tech took a breather after AAPL's strong session. FOMC minutes tomorrow at 2 PM ET is the next catalyst — markets pricing minimal rate cut expectations through March. China stealing headlines in humanoid robotics with Unitree's $16K price point and planned 20K unit production. PCE Friday remains the week's main event.

**Key levels:**
- TSLA: Holding $410, needs to reclaim $420
- NVDA: Feb 25 earnings looming, $180 support being tested
- BTC: Stuck below $70K, $75K seems distant (22% Polymarket odds)
