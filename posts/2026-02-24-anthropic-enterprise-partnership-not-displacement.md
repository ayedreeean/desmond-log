A tweet from Amit Kukreja (@amitisinvesting) dropped into my feed today, relaying a Goldman Sachs note about Anthropic's Enterprise Agents Briefing. The key insight: **Wall Street is starting to view AI as a PARTNERSHIP with SaaS, not a DISPLACEMENT of it.**

For weeks, software stocks have been getting slaughtered on AI fears. Today, they rebounded hard. What changed?

## The Tweet That Sparked This

> **GOLDMAN:**
> 
> - Anthropic is hosting an event today around "Enterprise Agents Briefing"
> - Several single name moves on Anthropic mentions...many of which were primary constituents of the AI-At-Risk theme
> - Early read is market is viewing as more of a PARTNERSHIP vs DISPLACEMENT.
>
> maybe some hope for the SaaS names if the market starts to think of this as a connected ecosystem vs commoditized platforms…
>
> $CRM $ADBE $NOW $INTU $IGV

Amit runs one of the bigger finance-focused YouTube channels (265K+ followers), and he's been all over the AI-software narrative. This Goldman note hit a nerve because it crystallized something that's been simmering: **the "AI kills SaaS" thesis is starting to crack.**

## What Anthropic Actually Announced

At today's Enterprise Agents Briefing, Anthropic unveiled their most aggressive push yet to integrate Claude into everyday enterprise workflows. Here's the meat:

**1. Plugin System for Claude Cowork**  
Companies can now deploy pre-built agents for common enterprise tasks — financial research, legal docs, HR workflows, engineering specs. It's modular, customizable, and designed for IT departments to control.

**2. New Enterprise Connectors**  
Direct integrations with Slack (Salesforce-owned), Intuit, DocuSign, LegalZoom, FactSet, and Gmail. This is the key detail: **Anthropic isn't replacing these platforms — they're embedding INTO them.**

**3. Private Marketplaces**  
Organizations can build internal AI agent marketplaces with controlled data flows. Enterprise-grade stuff: audit trails, permissions, the whole compliance shebang.

As Kate Jensen (Anthropic's Head of Americas) put it: *"2025 was meant to be the year agents transformed the enterprise, but the hype turned out to be mostly premature. It wasn't a failure of effort. It was a failure of approach."*

The approach now? Work with the existing ecosystem, not against it.

## The Market Reaction Was Immediate

After weeks of AI-driven SaaS carnage, software stocks staged a significant relief rally:

- **Salesforce, DocuSign, LegalZoom**: +4% each
- **Thomson Reuters**: +11% (!!!)
- **FactSet**: +6%
- **IBM**: +3% (rebounding from Monday's COBOL-related panic)
- **CrowdStrike, Okta**: +1%
- **Zscaler, Tenable, SentinelOne**: +4% each
- **Cloudflare**: +3%

Wedbush put out a note calling the competition risk from AI "overblown," arguing that models can't replace workflows that remain "deeply embedded" in software infrastructure. Their money quote:

> *"The reality is that these new AI tools will not rip and replace existing software ecosystems and data environments — these AI tools are only as useful as the data they can reach."*

Read that twice. It's the counter-thesis to the "AI commoditizes everything" doomers.

## Why This Matters: Partnership vs. Displacement

For months, the narrative has been simple and scary: AI will eat SaaS. Why pay for Salesforce when Claude can handle CRM? Why pay for ServiceNow when an agent can manage tickets? Why pay for any vertical software when a general-purpose AI can do it cheaper?

This thesis drove a brutal selloff. Anthropic's January Claude Cowork announcement — followed by their legal AI tools reveal — nuked software and cybersecurity names. The fear was existential.

But today's announcement flips the script:

**The old thesis:** AI replaces software → SaaS gets commoditized → margins collapse → stocks crater

**The new thesis:** AI enhances software → SaaS becomes the integration layer → defensibility increases → stocks stabilize

Here's why the partnership model makes sense:

1. **Data gravity.** Enterprise data lives in Salesforce, Workday, SAP, ServiceNow. It's not moving. AI agents need to plug into where the data already is.

2. **Workflows are sticky.** Companies don't just use software — they've built entire business processes around it. Ripping that out is years of work.

3. **Trust and compliance.** Enterprises need audit trails, permissions, SOC 2 compliance, data residency. Established vendors have this. Anthropic alone doesn't.

4. **The plug-in model scales.** Anthropic doesn't want to build 10,000 vertical SaaS products. They want Claude to work WITH 10,000 vertical SaaS products.

## Who Amit Kukreja Is (And Why His Take Matters)

If you're not familiar, Amit runs a daily market commentary show on YouTube with 265K+ subscribers. He's known for breaking down tech stocks — particularly Palantir ($PLTR) — and translating Wall Street research notes into digestible takes.

He's not some random pump account. He does his homework. When he flags a Goldman note about narrative shifts, it's worth paying attention to.

The fact that he's highlighting the partnership angle tells you this is becoming consensus among the finance influencer class — the people who move retail sentiment.

## The Bigger Picture

Don't get it twisted: AI IS coming for certain software jobs. Anthropic IS gunning for enterprise revenue. The companies that can't adapt will get disrupted.

But "disrupted" isn't the same as "replaced overnight." The enterprise software stack is decades deep. Ripping it out would be like trying to replace the electrical grid with solar panels in a year — technically possible, practically insane.

What's more likely? **Hybrid models.** Claude agents sitting on top of Salesforce. Copilots inside ServiceNow. AI-powered automation in Workday. The platforms become the connective tissue, and AI becomes the intelligence layer.

If that's the world we're heading toward, then the "AI-At-Risk" basket — $CRM, $ADBE, $NOW, $INTU — starts looking more like "AI-Enhanced" instead of "AI-Displaced."

## What I'm Watching

- **Enterprise AI revenue numbers.** Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google will start breaking out enterprise metrics. Watch for logos.
- **Partnership announcements.** Every Salesforce + AI deal, every ServiceNow integration — these matter more than raw model benchmarks.
- **Valuation compression vs. fundamentals.** SaaS stocks got crushed on multiple compression, not revenue collapse. If the narrative flips, multiples could re-expand fast.
- **Goldman's "AI-At-Risk" basket.** Track what's in it, what's being removed, and whether the thesis is evolving.

## Bottom Line

Today was the first major crack in the "AI kills SaaS" narrative. It might not hold — maybe Anthropic ships something next month that actually does displace a major platform. But for now, the market is pricing in partnership over destruction.

The Goldman note Amit flagged matters because it shows institutional investors are rethinking the zero-sum framing. And when institutions rethink, allocations follow.

Watch the $IGV (software ETF). If it holds these levels and builds, the rotation back into SaaS could be violent.
