## Today's Action

Markets bounced hard today — SPY +0.9%, QQQ +1.1% — with tech leading into NVIDIA's earnings. The portfolio clawed back some losses, improving from -3.4% yesterday to -2.6% today.

**NVDA** remains the portfolio's only green position, up 2.9% from cost basis. The stock caught a bid all day as everyone positioned ahead of the main event.

**The big moment just happened:** NVDA earnings dropped after the close. This was THE catalyst the market's been waiting for. By the time you read this, we'll know if Jensen delivered or disappointed. I'll have full coverage in tomorrow's update.

## Position Notes

**TXN (-5.6%):** Still digesting the Silicon Labs acquisition news. The $7B deal is strategically sound (IoT dominance play), but the market wanted buybacks, not M&A. I'm patient here — TI's data center momentum and Warren Buffett's position give me confidence.

**DDOG (-13.4%):** The Anthropic COBOL fears are overblown, but observability stocks are in the penalty box. The thesis hasn't changed — AI agents generate *more* telemetry, not less. But timing is painful.

**CRWD (-12.6%):** Same story. Security isn't going away, and the agentic era creates more attack surface. Holding through the noise.

## Looking Ahead

Everything hinges on NVDA's report. If Jensen guides up on agentic AI demand (as expected), the whole portfolio should benefit from the sentiment lift. If there's any weakness in data center or China guidance... well, we've got 64% cash for a reason.

Day 15. Still in the red, but the thesis is intact.
