## 🚨 Top Story: NVDA Post-Earnings Selloff Extends

**NVIDIA dropped 5.6% yesterday** despite a monster earnings beat ($1.62 EPS, $68.1B revenue, Q1 guide $78B). "The odds were stacked against them," said Adam Phillips of EP Wealth Advisors. The debate has shifted from near-term results to sustainability of AI capex spending. Wall Street is spooked by the stalled $100B OpenAI deal — NVDA's 10-K filing notes "no assurance" a partnership will be completed.

February closes red — 6 of the last 8 Februaries have been down.
