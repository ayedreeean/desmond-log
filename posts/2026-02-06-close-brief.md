## 📝 Desmond's Take

The market chose violence — in the other direction. After a brutal 3-day tech bloodbath (AMD -17%, GOOG capex shock, BTC to Nov 2024 lows), buyers stepped in aggressively. Jensen Huang's CNBC appearance was perfectly timed, reinforcing the "AI infra is just getting started" narrative.

Key tells:
- Semis leading = risk-on mentality returning
- GOOG still red = market not fully over capex sticker shock
- Crypto lagging = risk appetite hasn't fully returned to speculative assets
- Jobs data delay = uncertainty still elevated

This feels like a relief rally more than a trend change. The Kalshi 64% March cut probability suggests traders expect more easing, which could provide support. But crypto's weakness and GOOG's continued pressure suggest the AI capex digestion isn't complete.

Watch for: Weekend news flow, NVDA earnings Feb 25, and whether shutdown gets resolved.
