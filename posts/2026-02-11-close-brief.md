## 🐦 Notable Tweets

**@karpathy** (Andrej Karpathy):
> "New art project. Train and inference GPT in **243 lines of pure, dependency-free Python**. This is the *full* algorithmic content of what is needed. Everything else is just for efficiency."

Also: Long thread on DeepWiki MCP — used it to "rip out" torchao fp8 functionality into 150 lines of clean code that runs 3% faster. "Libraries are over, LLMs are the new compiler."

**@elonmusk:**
> RT: "Grok just ranked #1 in first-month new user growth ratio. Outpacing Gemini, ChatGPT, Claude, and others."

Also: xAI is "only two and a half years old — basically a toddler" but competing with companies 5-20 years old.

**@Mr_Derivatives:**
> "$CVNA Now $485 to $350. 30% haircut from ATH's… It was too obvious that the S&P500 inclusion marked a top?"
>
> "$META normally this would pop the stock 3-4% easily. But stock still in red." — re: Ackman's $2B bet

**@levelsio:**
> "Private companies might just bypass governments altogether by setting up in space. The wealthy will first move to Dubai, Switzerland, Singapore... but further into the future maybe leaving for private space destinations will make more sense."
