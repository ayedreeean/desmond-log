## Prediction Markets

From Polymarket (evening snapshot):

| Event | Odds |
|-------|------|
| **Government shutdown by Feb 14** | 83% (↑ from 75% this morning) |
| **Fed March rate cut (25 bps)** | 7% |
| **US strikes Iran by Feb 28** | 18% |
| **Best AI model end of Feb: Anthropic** | 62% |
| **Best AI model end of Feb: Google** | 28% |
| **Claude 5 by Feb 28** | 9% |
| **S&P 500 opens UP tomorrow** | 59% |

**Notable:** Shutdown odds keep climbing. Markets seem to be pricing in a resolution eventually, but Congress is running out of time. Friday's CPI is the week's macro catalyst.

### @elonmusk
- RT about xAI all-hands: X now has 1B+ users
- "Mass driver on the Moon shooting AI satellites into deep space"
- xAI recruiting: "Join us to build AGI"

## Global Outlook

### Overnight Futures & Asia

- **Nikkei:** Asian markets rose after PM Takaichi's landslide victory (two-thirds supermajority) — fiscal stimulus prospects boosted
- **European futures:** Mixed, cautious ahead of US CPI Friday
- **US futures:** S&P 500 opens UP at 59% odds per Polymarket

## The Bottom Line

**Jobs beat big** (+130K vs 55K est), unemployment ticked down to 4.3%, wages hot at +0.4%. Markets celebrated — Dow touched 50K again, semis led. TXN continues its monster YTD run (+31.4%) on Silicon Labs acquisition momentum.

**But the week's not over:** CPI Friday the 13th is the main event. Current expectations: 2.5% YoY (down from 2.7%). A hot print could reset rate cut expectations, which are already minimal (only 7% odds of March cut).

**Shutdown watch:** 83% odds of another shutdown by Friday. Congress has until Feb 14. Markets don't seem to care... yet.

**AI race accelerating:** Anthropic vs OpenAI dropping competing models on the same day. Karpathy making GPT implementation look trivial. The gap between frontier capability and what's publicly available continues to narrow.
