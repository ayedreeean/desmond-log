## After-Hours Movers

| Ticker | Close | Change | After-Hours |
|--------|-------|--------|-------------|
| **TSLA** | $421.81 | -2.00% | $425.21 (+0.81%) |
| **TXN** | $225.01 | **+4.39%** | $225.30 (+0.13%) |
| **NVDA** | $185.68 | -2.85% | ~flat |
| **SPY** | ~$606 (SPX 6,976) | +0.54% | ~flat |
| **QQQ** | ~$530 (IXIC 23,592) | +0.56% | ~flat |
| **SMH** | est. +1.8-2.0% | (semis strong) | ~flat |

**Standout:** TXN absolutely ripped today — hit a fresh **52-week high** at $225.26 on blowout data center order growth (+70%). Analysts raising targets left and right (Jefferies: $180→$210, maintains Hold). YTD return is now **+30.5%**, crushing the S&P's +1.9%.

**TSLA** slid 2% despite a generally green tape. The SpaceX-xAI merger news is generating buzz but analysts are lowering EV profit forecasts amid increased spending. After-hours recovering slightly to $425.

**NVDA** down nearly 3% — selling pressure continues as the street positions ahead of the Feb 25 earnings report. Still up 61% over the past year.

**Broad market** closed solidly green: Dow +1.05% (49,407), S&P +0.54% (6,976), Nasdaq +0.56% (23,592). The ISM Manufacturing print this morning was the story of the day.

## Earnings Recap

### Today's Headline: ISM Manufacturing Blowout

Not an earnings report, but the most important data point today: **ISM Manufacturing surged to 52.6%** vs. 48.4% expected and 47.9% prior. This marks the return to expansion territory after months of contraction. The S&P flash manufacturing PMI also came in strong at 52.4. Markets liked it — broad risk-on.

### PLTR (After-Hours Earlier)
Palantir reported after close with results that beat estimates. Stock at $147.74 (+0.79% during session), holding steady in extended hours.

### HOOD
Robinhood got hammered during regular hours: **-9.62%** to $89.91 on heavy volume (59M shares vs 25M avg). Watching the $85 support level @MR_Derivatives flagged tonight.

## Tomorrow's Watch

### 📊 Economic Calendar — Tuesday, Feb 3

| Time (ET) | Report | Est. | Prior |
|-----------|--------|------|-------|
| **9:45 AM** | S&P Final U.S. Services PMI (Jan) | 52.5 | — |
| **10:00 AM** | ⭐ **JOLTS Job Openings** (Dec) | 7.1M | 7.1M |
| **10:00 AM** | ⭐ **ISM Services** (Jan) | 53.5% | 54.4% |

**Must-watch:** JOLTS and ISM Services. After the manufacturing ISM blew out this morning, the services print will tell us if the entire economy is re-accelerating. A strong number could push rate cut expectations further out. JOLTS is the Fed's favorite labor demand gauge.

### 📈 Key Earnings — Tuesday, Feb 3

| Company | Time | EPS Est. |
|---------|------|----------|
| ⭐ **AMD** | AMC | $1.32 |
| **Merck (MRK)** | BMO | $2.01 |
| **PepsiCo (PEP)** | BMO | $2.24 |
| **Amgen (AMGN)** | AMC | $4.76 |
| **Pfizer (PFE)** | BMO | $0.57 |
| **PayPal (PYPL)** | BMO | $1.29 |
| **Eaton (ETN)** | BMO | $3.32 |
| **Chipotle (CMG)** | AMC | $0.24 |
| **EA** | AMC | $1.48 |
| **Take-Two (TTWO)** | AMC | -$0.39 |

**AMD is the headliner.** After NVDA's recent weakness, the street is watching AMD's data center revenue and AI chip trajectory closely. Any guidance upside could lift the entire semi space.

### 📅 Rest of the Week

- **Wed:** ADP Employment (Jan, est. 45K), Fed Gov. Lisa Cook speaks
- **Thu:** Initial Jobless Claims (est. 212K), Atlanta Fed Bostic speaks
- **Fri:** ⭐ **Jobs Report** (Jan, est. 55K), Unemployment Rate (est. 4.4%), Consumer Sentiment prelim (est. 54.0), Fed Vice Chair Jefferson speaks
  - *Note: Jobs data marked as potentially delayed due to Labor Dept funding lapse*

## Notable Tweets

### @elonmusk
**SpaceX-xAI merger officially announced.** Musk confirmed the formal merger and is framing it as building toward a "Kardashev Type II Civilization" — moving AI off Earth and into space. Also hyping Grok Imagine as the new #1 AI video model, and pushing x.ai as a Wikipedia replacement ("best open source distillation of all knowledge"). The Grok Batch API also went live tonight.

### @realDonaldTrump
All Melania documentary, all the time. The film apparently had the best documentary opening in a decade (~$8M) with an "A" CinemaScore. Five straight posts promoting it.

### @karpathy
Two threads worth reading:
1. **RSS revival** — advocating for ditching algorithmic feeds and going back to RSS/Atom. Shared a list of 92 popular blog RSS feeds from HN. "Something has to change."
2. **nanochat trains GPT-2 for $73** — down from $43K in 2019, a **600x cost reduction** in 7 years (~2.5x per year). Uses Flash Attention 3, Muon optimizer, gated residual pathways. Created a leaderboard for "time to GPT-2."

### @MR_Derivatives (Heisenberg)
Bullish vibes tonight. Posted futures chart with "Where are you bears?!" Flagged **$HOOD $85** as a key confluence support level and a potential **$RDDT** swing trade setup. On a self-described "earnings heater."

### @aelluswamy
Tesla Robotaxi rides **without safety monitors** are now publicly available in Austin. Multiple user-recorded videos of fully unsupervised rides. Fleet is mixed (some with monitors, some without), ratio increasing over time.

### @levelsio
Off-topic tonight — real estate agent rants from Brazil, French retirement income commentary, and German culture takes. No tech/startup content this round.

## Global Outlook

### Markets & Futures
- **Nikkei 225:** +2.79% to 54,125 — ripping on the strong US manufacturing data spillover
- **FTSE 100:** +1.15% to 10,342
- **Euro STOXX:** +1.03% to 617
- **Dow Futures:** Pointing mildly positive after the strong session
- **S&P Futures:** Roughly flat in early overnight trading

### Commodities & Rates
- **Gold:** $4,622.50 (flat — still digesting Friday's selloff after the Warsh Fed nomination)
- **Brent Crude:** $66.45 (+0.23%)
- **US 10Y:** 4.275% (basically unchanged)
- **UK 10Y:** 4.313% (-19.4 bps — notable move)
- **EUR/USD:** 1.1813 (+0.19%)

### Geopolitical
- The SpaceX-xAI merger is the biggest corporate story tonight — implications for defense, AI, and space sectors
- Gold's weakness after the Warsh Fed Chair nomination continues to be a theme. Market reading it as hawkish signal
- No major escalation on trade/tariff front tonight

## Bottom Line

Strong start to February. ISM Manufacturing back in expansion was the catalyst. TXN leading the charge in semis (your backyard). Tomorrow is stacked: AMD earnings after close is the marquee event, plus JOLTS and ISM Services data. The jobs report Friday is the week's main event — especially with the funding lapse asterisk. Overnight tone is constructive with Asia rallying hard.
