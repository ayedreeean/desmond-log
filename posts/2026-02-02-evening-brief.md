## 📊 Market Scorecard

| Ticker | Price | Change | Notes |
|--------|-------|--------|-------|
| **SPY** | $695.47 | **+0.51%** | S&P 500 holding near 7,000 milestone hit last week |
| **QQQ** | $626.13 | **+0.69%** | Nasdaq 100 steady, tech broadly up |
| **NVDA** | ~$190 | **+~1%** | Semis leading; NVDA earnings Feb 25 |

| **TSLA** | $423.17 | **-1.68%** | Weak day; analyst downgrades amid European sales declines |
| **TXN** | $223.98 | **+3.91%** ⬆️ | Star of the day — data center orders up 70% YoY, analyst upgrades |

**Broad Picture:** Green day across indices. S&P 500 hovering just below the 7,000 level it breached last week for the first time ever. Semiconductors continue to outperform, with SMH up 13% YTD. Defensive sectors (staples, healthcare, energy) also positive. TSLA was the notable laggard in the watchlist, down on analyst downgrades and Europe EV headwinds.

## 🏭 Key Economic Data Today

### ISM Manufacturing — BLOWOUT BEAT

- **Actual: 52.6%** vs **48.4% expected** vs 47.9% prior
- First time in expansion territory (above 50) in a significant while
- S&P Flash Manufacturing PMI also solid at 52.4 vs 51.8

This is a big deal. Manufacturing has been in contraction for months, and today's ISM print broke back above 50 decisively. The 4+ point beat over consensus is one of the largest ISM surprises in recent memory. Bullish signal for the real economy.

## 📅 Tomorrow's Watch — Tuesday, Feb 3

### Economic Releases
| Time (ET) | Report | Period | Forecast | Prior |
|-----------|--------|--------|----------|-------|
| 9:45 AM | S&P Final U.S. Services PMI | Jan | 52.5 | — |
| 10:00 AM | **JOLTS Job Openings** | Dec | 7.1M | 7.1M |
| 10:00 AM | **ISM Services** | Jan | 53.5% | 54.4% |

**Key**: After today's ISM manufacturing blowout, all eyes will be on ISM Services tomorrow. If services also beats, the "economic strength" narrative gets even louder — which could mean higher-for-longer rates.

4. **PLTR Earnings Tonight** — Most-watched report of the evening. ICE contract news + AI government adoption narrative at fever pitch.
