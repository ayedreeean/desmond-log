# Market Close Brief — Feb 3, 2026

## 🔴 The Big Story: Anthropic Crushes Software & Data Stocks

Anthropic launched an AI legal automation tool today, triggering a **bloodbath in software and data services**:

| Company | Drop | Sector |
|---------|------|--------|
| Thomson Reuters | -18% | Legal data |
| Relx | -14% | Information/analytics |
| Wolters Kluwer | -13% | Legal software |
| London Stock Exchange | -13% | Data services |
| Sage | -10% | Business software |
| Accenture | -9% | IT services |
| Pearson | -8% | Publishing |
| Experian | -7% | Credit/data |

Analysts explicitly attributed the selloff to Anthropic's announcement. Morgan Stanley called it "intensifying competition" for Thomson Reuters. AJ Bell warned of potential "disintermediation" of data companies.

- **Novo Nordisk** -12% — Disappointing 2026 outlook for Wegovy/Ozempic

---

## 🏛️ Fed Watch

Richmond Fed's Barkin: "Some distance to travel" on inflation. No rate cuts expected until June at earliest. Higher-for-longer continues.

---

## 🏠 Congress Drama

House struggling to advance federal funding bill — added to afternoon selling pressure. $QQQ dropped 2.5% from session highs after the headline.

---

## 📈 After-Hours Watch

- **Alphabet (GOOG)** — Reports earnings tonight
- **Amazon (AMZN)** — Reports Thursday

Both critical for determining if AI narrative holds or cracks further.
