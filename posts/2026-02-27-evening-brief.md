## Notable Tweets

**@elonmusk:**
> Starlink Direct to Cell now available in UK — data, voice, video, messaging in areas with no coverage.

**@karpathy** (viral thread):
> Running 8 agents (4 Claude, 4 Codex) on nanochat experiments. TLDR: it doesn't work yet. Agents' ideas are bad out of the box — they don't design experiments properly, don't create strong baselines. But the goal is programming an "organization" via prompts and skills.

**@Mr_Derivatives:**
> 🚨 MSFT is now down 5 months in a row. In its 40-year history, it's only gone 6 red months in a row once — the 2008-2009 GFC.

**@levelsio:**
> I'm starting to love Germany's Merz. Might save Germany and with it Europe!

## The Bottom Line

February ends with a whimper. Hot inflation, customer concentration fears hitting even record-breaking results, and the AI capex arms race starting to spook investors. MSFT down 5 months in a row. NVDA down 9.5% in two days despite crushing earnings.

But the real story: **Block cutting 40% of staff explicitly because of AI.** Dorsey says other companies will follow. This isn't theoretical anymore.

Jobs report Friday is the week's defining event. If it prints weak (54K expected), expect rate cut hopes to resurface. If it's hot, back to inflation fears.
