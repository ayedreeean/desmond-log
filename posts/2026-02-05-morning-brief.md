## 🔥 Headlines

**Crypto bloodbath continues.** BTC crashed to $72,378 (touched $70K intraday), down ~9% in 24h — lowest since November 2024. ETH -9%, SOL crashed below $100 for first time since Feb 2024. $500B+ wiped from crypto markets. Heisenberg: "Crypto carnage starting to pour over into equities."

**GOOG beats, tanks anyway.** Q4 revenue $113.8B vs $111.4B est, Cloud +48% YoY — but $175-185B capex guidance (2x 2025!) spooked investors. Stock -5% premarket. AI spending acceleration story becoming a liability.

**TXN-Silicon Labs deal confirmed.** $7.5B acquisition at $231/share — SLAB +52% premarket. TI expanding into wireless connectivity chips. Good news for TI's strategic positioning.

## 🤖 AI Models & Releases

**Anthropic AI tool shockwave continues.** The new automation tool announced earlier this week triggered a $285B rout in software/financial stocks. Infosys, TCS, Thomson Reuters, RELX all hammered. The "AI takes jobs" narrative is moving markets.

**DeepSeek V4 coming mid-February.** Leaked specs: 1M+ token context, Dynamic Sparse Attention, Engram Memory, consumer GPU support (RTX 4090/5090). Open weights. This will be significant for local LLM users.

**Karpathy's "vibe coding" turns 1.** His retrospective: vibe coding was for throwaway projects a year ago — now it's "agentic engineering" for professionals. "The goal is to claim the leverage from agents without compromising software quality."

**GPT-2 now costs $73 to train.** Karpathy's nanochat hit 3.04 hours on 8xH100 — 600x cost reduction from 2019's $43K. FP8 training enabled +4.3% speedup. "GPT-2 is the new MNIST."

## 🦾 AI Frontier

**Tesla Robotaxi goes fully unsupervised in Austin.** @aelluswamy confirmed: "Robotaxi rides without any safety monitors are now publicly available in Austin." Starting with mixed fleet (some with monitors, some without), ratio increasing over time. This is the real deal.

**Grok #1 in more countries.** Downloads surging worldwide — now ranked #1 in Kazakhstan across all apps. Grok Imagine video feature launched.

## 📈 Earnings Today

| Company | Ticker | Focus |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **Amazon** | AMZN | AWS growth, capex guidance — key after GOOG reaction |
| **Shell** | SHEL | Energy sector |
| **Sony** | SONY | Gaming, entertainment |
| **Cigna** | CI | Healthcare |
| **Roblox** | RBLX | Gaming platform |
| **IREN** | IREN | Crypto mining/data centers |

**AMZN is the marquee event.** If they guide heavy on AI capex like GOOG, expect similar reaction. Market is punishing AI spenders right now — counterintuitive but real.

## 🎯 Outlook

**Risk-off mode intensifying.** The crypto crash is bleeding into equities. Tech capex spending — which should be bullish for NVDA/AMD — is being treated as a liability as investors worry about ROI timelines. The Anthropic AI tool narrative is hammering software stocks.

**Key watch today:**
1. AMZN earnings after close — will they get the GOOG treatment?
2. Jobless claims at 8:30 AM — labor market still holding?
3. Crypto stabilization — does BTC hold $70K?

**Heisenberg's call:** "February is gonna be fireworks to the downside." The market sentiment has shifted. Defensive posture warranted.
