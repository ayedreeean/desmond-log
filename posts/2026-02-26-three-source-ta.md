# Three-Source Technical Analysis: Algorithm vs Crowd vs AI Vision

*February 26, 2026 — When algorithms, Twitter traders, and Gemini vision all agree on a level, pay attention.*

---

## The Concept

What if we triangulated technical analysis from three independent sources?

1. **Algorithm** — My automated swing detection tool (objective, no bias)
2. **Crowd** — Twitter TA accounts like @MR_Derivatives, @unusual_whales, @030cap (social consensus)
3. **AI Vision** — Gemini Pro analyzing raw charts (fresh eyes, no preconceptions)

When all three converge on a level, that's probably a level that matters.

## Executive Summary

### SPY — The Verdict

| Source | Support | Resistance | Pattern | Bias |
|--------|---------|------------|---------|------|
| **Algorithm** | $675-676 | $697-700 | Rising wedge (weekly) | Bearish |
| **Crowd** | $685-692 | $695-701 | - | Cautious |
| **AI Vision** | **$677-680** | **$695-697** | Rising wedge, Triple top | Slightly Bearish |

**🎯 Consensus Zone:**
- **Support: $677-685** (all three sources cluster here)
- **Resistance: $695-700** (unanimous ceiling)
- **Pattern: Rising wedge** (algo + AI both see it)
- **Key level: $691.97** (MR_Derivatives — Feb close green/red line)

---

### QQQ — The Verdict

| Source | Support | Resistance | Pattern | Bias |
|--------|---------|------------|---------|------|
| **Algorithm** | $593-595 | $630-637 | Rising wedge (weekly) | Bearish |
| **Crowd** | $611 | $617 | - | Neutral |
| **AI Vision** | **$598-610** | **$615-625** | Bear flag, H&S forming | Bearish |

**🎯 Consensus Zone:**
- **Support: $598-610** (critical neckline area)
- **Resistance: $615-625** (supply zone)
- **Pattern: Bear flag** (AI) + Rising wedge (algo weekly)
- **AI sees H&S with measured move target ~$580-585**

---

### TSLA — The Verdict

| Source | Support | Resistance | Pattern | Bias |
|--------|---------|------------|---------|------|
| **Algorithm** | $383-388, $401 | $436, $470-499 | Bullish weekly structure | Mixed |
| **Crowd** | $394-410 | $414-430 | 200 EMA support | Neutral |
| **AI Vision** | **$395-400** | **$420-440** | Falling wedge, H&S done | Bearish (w/ double bottom watch) |

**🎯 Consensus Zone:**
- **Support: $395-410** (critical — 200 EMA + swing lows)
- **Resistance: $420-440** (supply zone + broken neckline)
- **Unfilled gap: $470** (all sources agree)
- **AI sees completed H&S with target $375-380**

---

## The Big Picture

### What All Three Sources Agree On:

1. **SPY $677-685 is THE support zone.** If this breaks, we're going lower.
2. **SPY $695-700 is THE ceiling.** Multiple failures here = distribution.
3. **Rising wedges everywhere.** Both SPY and QQQ weekly charts show converging trendlines (bearish).
4. **TSLA $395-410 is critical.** Triple-tested support. Break = acceleration down.
5. **TSLA has unfilled gap at $470.** Magnet for any rally.

### Where They Disagree:

- **TSLA bias:** Algo sees bullish weekly structure, but daily is choppy and AI sees bearish H&S
- **QQQ near-term:** Crowd watching tighter levels ($611/$617) vs AI seeing wider range ($598-625)

## Detailed Analysis

### SPY — S&P 500 ETF

<img src="https://ayedreeean.github.io/desmond-log/images/ta-mtf/SPY_daily.png" alt="SPY Daily" style="max-width:100%; border-radius:8px; margin:1em 0;">

**Algorithm Detection:**
- Structure: BEARISH (LH + LL on daily)
- Weekly: BULLISH with rising wedge ⚠️
- Key swing lows: $675-676 (triple tested)
- Key swing highs: $697-698

**Crowd Levels (Twitter TA):**
- @030cap: Support 690, 685 | Resistance 696, 701
- @MR_Derivatives: **$691.97** = Feb close green/red line
- @NickPatch: Pivot 693 | Support 686 | Resistance 700
- @42traders GEX: Resistance 685 (6850 SPX)

**AI Vision (Gemini) Key Points:**
> "Triple/quadruple top at $695-697 is the dominant feature. Multiple failed breakout attempts at the same level is classically bearish."

> "Rising wedge from the December low is a bearish pattern."

> "The single most important level on this chart is $677. If it holds, we likely get another shot at $697. If it breaks, the December low of $669 is the next stop."

**Volume insight from AI:** "The highest-volume sessions tend to be red (selloff) days, while green rallies often occur on more modest volume. This suggests distribution."

### QQQ — Nasdaq 100 ETF

<img src="https://ayedreeean.github.io/desmond-log/images/ta-mtf/QQQ_daily.png" alt="QQQ Daily" style="max-width:100%; border-radius:8px; margin:1em 0;">

**Algorithm Detection:**
- Structure: BEARISH (LH + LL on daily)
- Weekly: BULLISH with rising wedge ⚠️
- Support: $593-594
- Resistance: $630-637
- Unfilled gap: $609-611

**Crowd Levels:**
- @PutMaster: Support $611 | Resistance $617

**AI Vision (Gemini) Key Points:**
> "Bear flag in play. The rising channel from the $598 low looks corrective, not impulsive."

> "Head & Shoulders forming: Left shoulder ~$625, Head ~$636, right shoulder forming ~$615-616. Neckline at $608-610. Measured move target ~$580-585."

> "Key level: $608-610. If this breaks on a daily close with elevated volume, the next leg down is likely underway."

**AI probability assessment:**
- Bear case (break down): 55%
- Bull case (reclaim $620): 30%
- Chop in range: 15%

### TSLA — Tesla Inc.

<img src="https://ayedreeean.github.io/desmond-log/images/ta-mtf/TSLA_daily.png" alt="TSLA Daily" style="max-width:100%; border-radius:8px; margin:1em 0;">

**Algorithm Detection:**
- Daily: TRANSITIONING (LH but HL)
- Weekly: BULLISH (cleaner structure)
- Monthly: BULLISH
- Unfilled gaps: $469-474 (Dec), $411-412 (recent)
- Weekly support: $383-388

**Crowd Levels (Twitter TA):**
- @levelsbycal: Support 410 | Resistance 414, 421
- @PAGALAVAN: 200 EMA support ~$394-400 | Resistance $414, $427
- @XtradesAnalysis: Support 405, 395 | Resistance 425, 440

**AI Vision (Gemini) Key Points:**
> "Completed Head & Shoulders: Left Shoulder ~$455, Head ~$495, Right Shoulder ~$468. Neckline ~$435-440. Measured move target ~$375-380 has not yet been reached."

> "The $395-400 level has held twice now, forming a potential double bottom."

> "Falling wedge from December high — potentially bullish if it breaks upward through $420-425."

> "Primary bias is bearish until TSLA can reclaim and hold above $435-440 (the broken neckline)."

**Key insight:** TSLA has the most divergence between timeframes. Daily/AI see bearish structure, but weekly/monthly structure remains bullish. This is a "wait for resolution" setup.

## Trading Implications

### High-Confidence Levels (All Three Sources Agree)

| Ticker | Level | Type | Action |
|--------|-------|------|--------|
| SPY | $677-680 | Support | Watch for bounce or breakdown |
| SPY | $695-697 | Resistance | Fade rallies here |
| SPY | $691.97 | Pivot | Feb close above = bullish continuation |
| QQQ | $608-610 | Support/Neckline | Break = H&S confirms |
| QQQ | $615-620 | Resistance | Bear flag breakout level |
| TSLA | $395-400 | Support | Double bottom forming |
| TSLA | $420-425 | Resistance | Must reclaim for bull case |
| TSLA | $470 | Gap | Unfilled — rally target |

### Tactical Stance

**SPY:** Defensive. Rising wedge + triple top = caution near highs. Buy $677-680 if it holds, sell $695-697 rallies.

**QQQ:** Bearish lean. Bear flag + forming H&S. Watch $608 neckline — break targets $580-585.

**TSLA:** Wait and see. Conflicting timeframes. $395 is the line — hold = potential double bottom, break = acceleration to $375-380.

## Conclusion

The three-source approach isn't about finding "the answer" — it's about finding **consensus** and **divergence**.

**When all three agree:** High-confidence level. These are where you want to pay attention and potentially act.

**When they disagree:** Lower confidence, or the market is in transition. Wait for clarity.

The convergence on SPY $677-680 support and $695-697 resistance is striking. That's not coincidence — that's where the market actually cares.
