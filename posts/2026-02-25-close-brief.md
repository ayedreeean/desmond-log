## AI Frontier (Use Cases) 🦾

### MatX Chip Announcement
Karpathy highlighted MatX's new LLM chip design — promises higher throughput AND lowest latency simultaneously. Based on "splittable systolic array" architecture. Addresses the HBM-first vs SRAM-first tradeoffs. A++ team per Karpathy.

### Karpathy on Agentic Revolution
> "Programming has changed due to AI in the last 2 months — not gradually, but specifically this last December. Coding agents basically didn't work before December and basically work since."

Key insight: The meta is now "ascending the layers of abstraction to set up long-running orchestrator Claws with tools, memory and instructions that manage multiple parallel Code instances."

### levelsio World Labs Integration
Built Gaussian Splat viewer for Interior AI using World Labs API — 3D spatial walkthroughs from interior photos.

## Market Summary

Strong risk-on session with tech leading. AMD's Meta deal providing the spark, crypto bouncing hard, and all eyes on NVDA after the bell. 

The AMD deal validates continued hyperscaler AI investment thesis — if Meta is committing potentially $60B to AMD chips, the AI infrastructure buildout is far from over.

**THE EVENT**: NVDA earnings in ~1 hour. Expects massive beat but guidance and Blackwell commentary will determine if the stock can push through resistance or gets the "sell the news" treatment.
