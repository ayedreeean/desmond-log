## AI Models & Releases

### Major Releases Today

### Karpathy on AI Infrastructure
Long thread on memory+compute orchestration being "today's most interesting intellectual puzzle." The $4.6T NVDA prize. Key insight: inference decode over long token contexts in tight agentic loops is the hardest problem.

### Notable
- **Apple Mac mini** — Tim Cook: US production later this year as part of $600B commitment (Elon RT'd)

## AI Frontier (Use Cases)

### Agents & Tools
**Karpathy on Building for Agents:**
> "CLIs are super exciting precisely because they are a 'legacy' technology, which means AI agents can natively and easily use them."
>
> "If you have any kind of product or service think: can agents access and use them? It's 2026. Build. For. Agents."

He built a Polymarket terminal dashboard in 3 minutes using the new Polymarket CLI.

**@levelsio shipping tornado:**
- Batch remix photos with AI models (swap model in existing photoshoot)
- Gaussian splat viewer for Interior AI
- Voice upload for Photo AI

### Humanoid Robotics

## Bottom Line

The market found its footing after Monday's AI-induced panic. AMD's +8.66% Meta deal rally was the standout. But tomorrow is THE event:

**NVIDIA earnings will set the tone for the rest of the week.**

If Blackwell demand confirms the "insatiable AI compute" narrative, we could see semis resume leadership. If guidance disappoints or margins compress, the AI capex skepticism resurfaces.

Also watching Trump's State of the Union for any tariff/policy surprises.
