# AMD Q4: Beat Everything, Still Not Enough

**February 3, 2026 — After Hours**

AMD just posted a double beat on Q4 2025 — crushed EPS, crushed revenue, net income tripled YoY — and the stock dropped 7% after hours. Welcome to the AI expectations game.

## The Numbers

### Q4 2025 Results

| Metric | Actual | Expected | YoY |
|--------|--------|----------|-----|
| **EPS** | $1.53 | $1.32 | — |
| **Revenue** | $10.27B | $9.67B | +34% |
| **Net Income** | $1.51B | — | +213% ($482M yr-ago) |

### Segment Breakdown

| Segment | Revenue | YoY |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Data Center | $5.4B | +39% |
| Client / Gaming | $3.9B | +37% |
| Embedded | $950M | +3% |
| China MI308 | $390M | — |

Every segment grew. Data center is now over half of AMD's revenue. Client/gaming surged 37% — that's Intel's market share bleeding out in real time.

## Q1 2026 Guidance

| Metric | Guidance | Consensus |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| Revenue | $9.8B ± $300M | $9.38B |
| China MI308 | ~$100M | — |

Guidance beat consensus by $400M+. But there's a sequential decline from Q4's $10.27B, and China MI308 revenue craters from $390M to $100M as export controls bite.

## Why the Stock Dropped Anyway

Five reasons, in order of importance:

1. **Guidance wasn't explosive enough.** When NVDA is printing $30B+ quarters and hyperscalers are talking about $300B+ in AI capex, a sequential decline — even a small one — reads as "not keeping up."
2. **China is a headwind, not a tailwind.** MI308 going from $390M → $100M is a 74% drop. Export controls are real and getting tighter.
3. **Priced for perfection.** Stock doubled in the past year. A double beat isn't enough — you need a triple beat with raised guidance to move a stock this hot.
4. **Macro backdrop was already ugly.** Anthropic's legal AI tool announcement nuked software stocks today. NVDA -3.4%, Nasdaq wiped $1.1T. AMD reported into a fearful market.
5. **Classic sell-the-news.** Everyone knew AMD would beat. The buy happened over the last three months, not tonight.

## What's Being Ignored

The market is focused on the negatives, but several things deserve more attention:

- **Server CPU demand is "very strong."** AI doesn't just need GPUs — it needs CPUs, memory, networking. The rising tide lifts all server silicon.
- **Helios AI system.** AMD's upcoming integrated AI platform has "active discussions" for sales. This is their play to move up the stack from chips to systems.
- **Customer roster.** OpenAI and Oracle are AMD GPU customers. That's not a participation trophy — that's real validation against NVIDIA's CUDA moat.
- **Intel is dying.** Client/gaming +37% YoY is AMD feasting on Intel's corpse. This secular share gain isn't priced in enough.
- **Guidance still beat consensus.** $9.8B midpoint vs $9.38B expected. The whisper number was higher, sure — but beating published consensus by 4% isn't bad.

## My Take

This is a textbook case of expectations outrunning reality. AMD delivered a great quarter by any objective measure — 34% revenue growth, tripled net income, dominant in every segment. But in a market that's pricing AI stocks for exponential growth every single quarter, "great" isn't enough. You need "shocking."

The China headwind is real but manageable. MI308 going from $390M to $100M hurts, but AMD's data center business is $5.4B — China was 7% of it. The story isn't China. The story is whether AMD can close the gap with NVIDIA in the AI accelerator market, and Helios is their next shot at that.

At ~$106 after hours (down from ~$114 close), AMD trades at roughly 25x forward earnings on a 34% growth rate. That's... not expensive. If you believe AI infrastructure spending is a multi-year cycle — and every hyperscaler's capex budget says it is — this pullback is a gift.

The risk is that NVIDIA's Blackwell ramp is so dominant that AMD's MI300/MI308 gets squeezed out before Helios can arrive. But with OpenAI and Oracle already buying AMD silicon, that thesis is weakening.

**Short term:** Probably more pain. The after-hours move sets the tone, and the broader tech selloff isn't done digesting today's damage.

**Medium term:** This is a buy-the-dip candidate if you're constructive on AI infrastructure.

## What's Next

**Alphabet (GOOG) reports tomorrow (Feb 4) after close.** Google's cloud and AI spending will be the next data point on whether the AI capex boom is accelerating or decelerating. If Google guides strong, it could lift the whole AI complex — including AMD.
