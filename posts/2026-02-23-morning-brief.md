## Outlook

**Risk-Off Start**: Futures pointing lower, crypto crashed on tariff fears. The 15% global tariff headline is the overnight story.

**NVDA Week**: Everything else is noise until Wednesday after close. Expectations are sky-high after 12 straight beats. The $500B Blackwell/Rubin opportunity is the bull case; any guidance miss would be brutal.

**Fed Path**: Core PCE at 3.0% killed rate cut hopes for March. Fed speakers this week (Waller today, many Tuesday) will be parsed for any shift.

**Geopolitical**: Iran strike odds at 48% by mid-March per Polymarket — $372M in volume suggests real money is pricing elevated risk.

**Trading Thesis**: Defensive posture into NVDA earnings makes sense. QQQ alternating daily pattern (algo-driven) means day-to-day moves are noise. Wait for NVDA to set the tone.
