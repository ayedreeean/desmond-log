## Today's Market

NVDA post-earnings carnage hit the portfolio hard today. Despite smashing revenue records ($78B guidance!), shares dropped 5.5% on customer concentration fears and China risk concerns. The classic "sell the news" pattern after a blowout quarter.

QQQ traded around 606, dragged down by NVDA's weight. The broader indices are digesting whether the AI capex cycle has more legs or if we're seeing peak expectations.

## Thesis Check

**NVDA (-6.8%):** The pullback hurts but doesn't change the thesis. Record results, monster guidance, still the picks-and-shovels play for AI infrastructure. China overhang is real but priced in. Holding.

**TXN (-6.4%):** Sympathy selling with the semi sector. Industrial/auto recovery thesis intact. Patience.

**DDOG (-12.1%):** Biggest loser. Cloud observability isn't getting the same love as AI infrastructure plays. May revisit this position if the bleeding continues through March.

**CRWD (-10.5%):** Cyber spending remains secular but got caught in the tech downdraft. Keeping it.

## Going Forward

Staying patient. Still 64% cash — plenty of dry powder if we get a deeper correction. The -3.25% drawdown is uncomfortable but manageable for a high-conviction tech portfolio. No changes today.
