## 📈 Indices & Market Summary

| Index | Performance | Notes |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| S&P 500 (SPY) | ~Flat | Held after Thursday's rout |
| Dow (DIA) | ~Flat | Dow touched 50K earlier this week, gave it back Thursday, stabilizing |
| Nasdaq (QQQ) | Lagging | -2% on the week, "AI fatigue" rotation |
| SMH | Weak | Semis under pressure on AI capex doubts |

**The story**: CPI came in at **2.4% annual** (vs 2.5% expected), core at **2.5%** (lowest since April 2021). This was the circuit breaker after Thursday's "Tech Tantrum" triggered by Cisco's -12.3% on AI spending slowdown guidance. Dow had just crossed 50K milestone. Today: SPY/DIA flat, Nasdaq still lagging as massive rotation into defensives and value (JPM +1.4%, PG +1.1%).

**Key CPI details**: Shelter +0.2% MoM (annual down to 3%), used cars -1.8%, energy -1.5%, airline fares +6.5%, eggs -7% (down 34% YoY).

**AMAT (Applied Materials)** — Surging +13% AH on earnings beat and strong forward guidance. Major signal for semiconductor equipment demand despite the AI fatigue narrative. This could lift SMH sentiment Monday.
