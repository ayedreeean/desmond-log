## 🚨 THE HEADLINE

**NVDA DELIVERS — BUT MARKET YAWNS.** Jensen beat on everything: $1.62 EPS vs $1.53 expected, $68.1B revenue (+73% YoY), Q1 guide $78B (beats by 7%). Stock popped 3.8% after hours, now only +1-1.7% pre-market. Classic "sell the news" setup. Demand is "off the charts" per Huang, but the street wants shock, not excellence.

## 🐦 Notable Tweets

### @karpathy (Feb 25)
> "It is hard to communicate how much programming has changed due to AI in the last 2 months... coding agents basically didn't work before December and basically work since... Programming is becoming unrecognizable. You're not typing computer code into an editor like the way things were since computers were invented, that era is over."

**Translation**: Karpathy built a complete video analysis dashboard by telling an agent to "log into my DGX Spark, set up vLLM, bench Qwen3-VL, build a web UI" — walked away for 30 mins, came back done. "The biggest prize is figuring out how to keep ascending the layers of abstraction."

### @elonmusk (Feb 26)
> "Much tunneling" — Boring Company now drilling in 3 states simultaneously (Nevada, Texas, Tennessee) at ~99% less than traditional costs

### @Mr_Derivatives (Feb 26)
> "South Korea's stock market is going apeshit like a meme coin. And no one has any idea why…?!"

Warning on KORU (3x Korea ETF): "Just be careful guys chasing a 3x bull ETF that has gone parabolic... one massive red day will wipe out KORU like they did AGQ with silver."

### @levelsio (Feb 25)
Building Interior AI + World Labs 3D integration — SketchUp → photorealistic render → walk around in 3D. "Very useful to show clients how it'll look."

## 📰 News

### Markets
- **NVDA Earnings**: Beat meets mixed premarket sentiment — investors eye jobless claims and geopolitical talks
- **Trump Tariffs**: 10% global rate came in lower than feared, markets "shrug it off" in classic TACO (Tariffs Always Cancel Out) pattern
- **Korea Rally**: EWY (Korea ETF) surging, KORU 3x parabolic — nobody knows why

### Geopolitics
- **US-Iran**: Turkey mediating talks, Israel demands complete "military emasculation" of Iran
- **EU Trade**: Halted ratification of US trade deal amid tariff confusion

---

## 🔮 Outlook

**Bull Case**: NVDA beat removes last Mag 7 uncertainty. Crypto bouncing. Korea money printing (maybe?). Fed on hold = stability.

**Bear Case**: NVDA "sell the news" pattern intact. Iran talks could fail. Tariff uncertainty lingers. Valuations still stretched.

**Key Levels**:
- SPY resistance: ATH area
- QQQ: Watch 50-day MA ($600 zone)
- BTC: $70K ceiling, $62.5K floor

**Today's Catalyst**: Jobless claims (8:30 AM) + Fed Bowman testimony. Watch for any hawkish surprises.
