## After-Hours Portfolio

Markets ended a choppy week with the S&P 500 flat at ~6,836 and Nasdaq -0.22% at 22,547. A softer-than-expected January CPI report couldn't spark a meaningful rally amid lingering AI capex concerns. Major indices down ~1.5% for the week.

**After-hours snapshot (via StockMarketWatch):**

| Ticker | AH Price | AH Move |
|--------|----------|---------|
| AAPL | $255.30 | -0.2% |
| NVDA | $182.88 | flat |
| TSLA | $417.44 | flat |
| GOOGL | $305.72 | flat |
| GOOG | $305.78 | -0.1% |
| AMD | $206.82 | -0.2% |
| PLTR | $131.72 | +0.2% |

*TXN, QQQ, SPY, SMH not in AH actives list — likely flat.*

**YTD context** (via @MR_Derivatives): TLT +3.1%, DIA +2.4%, SPY -0.2%, QQQ -1.8%. Bonds outperforming equities for the first time in a long while.

|-------|---------------|----------|

| SOL | ~$84 | +8.7% |

Strong bounce day for crypto. SOL still down 45% over 30 days from $142. Notable: SOL ETF seeing inflows while BTC/ETH ETFs saw $500M outflows this week (Nairametrics).

## Prediction Markets

**Supreme Court vs. Trump Tariffs — Feb 20 Opinion Day Set**
- SCOTUS has scheduled Feb 20 as next opinion day — potential ruling on Trump's sweeping tariff regime
- **Polymarket: 28% chance** SCOTUS rules in favor of Trump tariffs (down from 39% last week)
- **Kalshi: 30% chance** favorable ruling
- Justice KBJ flagged legal complexity; odds of forced tariff refund have crashed
- Over **$9M in bets** placed across both platforms on this question

**Fed Rate:** "Higher for longer" narrative reinforced despite soft CPI. FOMC minutes due Feb 18 — key for rate cut timeline.
