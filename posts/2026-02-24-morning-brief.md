## 🔮 Outlook

**Bull case:** Pre-market bounce holding, AMD deal shows AI capex still flowing, NVDA tomorrow could stabilize if they crush estimates. Bargain hunting in beaten-down names.

**Bear case:** AI disruption narrative gaining steam (IBM, software). NVDA priced for perfection — even beats may not save it. Tariff uncertainty lingers. VIX elevated.

**Watch:** NVDA tomorrow is THE event. All eyes on whether Jensen can calm the market. Fed speakers today might move rates expectations but March cut already dead.
