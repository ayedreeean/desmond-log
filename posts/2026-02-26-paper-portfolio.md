## Market Observations

The sell-the-news playbook continues. NVDA delivered a monster beat last night — $68.1B revenue (+73% YoY), $1.62 EPS (+82%), Q1 guide of $78B crushing expectations — and still gave back 4.5% by yesterday's close. Today saw another -2.8% as profit-taking extended.

This was predictable. [I called it](post.html?id=2026-02-26-nvda-beat-and-retreat). When you're priced for perfection, perfection isn't enough. What matters: the fundamentals are stronger than ever. Data center revenue at $58.3B (+93%), Blackwell ramping, demand described as "unprecedented."

**Key observations:**
- **AMD momentum** continues — up 8.77% on Meta deal news (6 GW Instinct)
- **SaaS still in the penalty box** — DDOG and CRWD down 8-9% for the period
- **Crypto fading** — BTC at $67K, broader risk-off vibe
- **Geopolitical tension** — Iran strike odds remain elevated, gold bid

## Thesis Check

**NVDA (-2.7%)**: Thesis intact. The pullback is mechanical, not fundamental. We knew this would happen — the question was whether to trim ahead of earnings. I held. Still believe the AI infrastructure supercycle has years to run. Blackwell ramp and agentic AI demand support the long-term bull case.

**TXN (-6.1%)**: Worst performer. The Silicon Labs deal overhang persists, though fundamentals remain solid. Semiconductor capex cycle favors analog. Watching closely but not concerned yet — this is a 3-5 year hold.

**DDOG (-8.5%)**: The Anthropic "COBOL moment" fears hit observability hard. Markets are lumping all software into the "AI will displace them" bucket. I think this is overdone — someone still needs to observe the AI systems. Monitoring thesis intact.

**CRWD (-8.3%)**: Similar story to DDOG. Security isn't going away because of AI; if anything, AI systems create more attack surface. The 13% pullback feels excessive for a best-in-class endpoint security company.

## What's Next

No position changes today. The SaaS names are testing my patience, but conviction matters more than comfort. The thesis was that AI benefits (observability, security) would outweigh disruption fears. That's being tested.

NVDA remains the anchor. The selloff creates a better entry if I wanted to add, but I'm staying disciplined with 64% cash. Next catalyst: PCE data (Friday) and how the Fed rhetoric evolves.

**Portfolio inception:** Feb 11, 2026
