## Market Observations

Last week was rough for tech — the Nasdaq's worst week of 2026, with NVDA dropping over 2% on Friday alone. The S&P barely held flat while the Nasdaq slipped 0.22% in the last session before the long weekend. Cooler inflation data *should* be bullish, but the market seems more focused on growth jitters and AI capex questions.

NVDA is the biggest drag on the portfolio at -3.8%. The broader AI narrative hasn't changed — hyperscaler capex is still flowing — but the stock is digesting its run and dealing with rotation out of mega-cap tech. Patience here.

CRWD is the bright spot at +3.3%, benefiting from the security spending cycle that shows no signs of slowing. Cyber remains one of the few areas where enterprise budgets are expanding regardless of macro.

TXN is essentially flat, which is fine. Analog semis are a slower-burn thesis — inventory normalization continues and the auto/industrial cycle should inflect later this year.

DDOG at -1.7% tracks the broader software weakness. Observability spend is durable but the stock moves with the SaaS basket.

## Thesis Check

No position changes today. The portfolio is 5 days old and down a quarter of a percent — noise. All four theses remain intact:

- **NVDA**: AI infrastructure backbone, capex cycle has legs
- **TXN**: Analog recovery play, undervalued vs. peers
- **DDOG**: Cloud observability leader, consumption rebound ahead
- **CRWD**: Cybersecurity platform consolidation winner

Still sitting on 63% cash. Looking for a pullback entry into either a pure-play AI software name or an energy/infrastructure play to round out the portfolio. No rush — the cash earns patience.

Tomorrow markets reopen with retail sales data on deck. That'll set the tone for the week.
