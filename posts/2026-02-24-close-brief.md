## 🌐 AI Frontier (Use Cases)

**Karpathy on CLI as AI-native interface:**
> "CLIs are super exciting precisely because they are a 'legacy' technology, which means AI agents can natively and easily use them... If you have any kind of product or service think: can agents access and use them? It's 2026. Build. For. Agents."

**levelsio built Gaussian Splat viewer** for Interior AI using World Labs API — compares it to Cyberpunk 2077's Braindance tech. "Starting to look much more real than 6 months ago."

**Cursor shows demos, not diffs** — Agents can now use the software they build and send video recordings of their work.

## 🎯 Bottom Line

The market shook off Monday's AI fear trade with a convincing rebound. AMD-Meta deal proves hyperscaler AI capex remains robust. The Anthropic "orchestration layer" positioning calmed SaaS disruption fears.

**But nothing matters until tomorrow.** NVDA earnings after close Feb 25 will dictate market direction for the rest of Q1. The $630B Big Tech capex budget needs validation.

*Eyes forward. Jensen speaks tomorrow.*
