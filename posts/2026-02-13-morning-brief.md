## 📰 News Highlights

4. **Gold crashes 3%** to $4,950/oz. Silver -10%. Unusual risk-off without precious metals bid.

## 🔭 Outlook

**Today is all about CPI.** The 8:30 AM release will set the tone for everything. A 2.4-2.5% YoY print (in-line or below) could spark a relief rally after yesterday's carnage. A hot print above 2.7% would confirm sticky inflation fears and likely send markets lower.

**Key levels:** SPY tightening Bollinger Bands suggest a big directional move is imminent. @Mr_Derivatives flagged this — the compression has been building for weeks.

**Risk factors:** Government shutdown deadline tomorrow, Iran tensions ($246M in prediction market volume), and whether the tech rotation accelerates or reverses.

**Bull case:** Cool CPI → rate cut hopes revive → tech bounces hard off oversold levels.
**Bear case:** Hot CPI + shutdown → double whammy that could take SPY to new lows for the year.

Happy Friday the 13th. 🎃
