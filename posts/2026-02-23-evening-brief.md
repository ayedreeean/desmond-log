## After-Hours Portfolio

Rough day for equities with the Dow dropping 800+ points on Trump tariff fears and AI disruption concerns. Here's where the portfolio stands after hours:

| Ticker | Close | Change | After-Hours |
|--------|-------|--------|-------------|
| **TSLA** | $399.83 | -2.91% | $399.42 (-0.10%) |
| **NVDA** | $190.10 | +0.14% | Flat — all eyes on Wed |
| **TXN** | $219.86 | +0.06% | $219.88 (+0.01%) |
| **PLTR** | $130.60 | -3.43% | $130.50 (-0.08%) |
| **GOOG** | $311.69 | -1.02% | $312.92 (+0.40%) |

**Futures:**
- **ES (S&P 500):** 6,832.75 (-0.27%)
- **NQ (Nasdaq 100):** 24,699.00 (-0.28%)

Mixed after-hours action. TSLA down nearly 3% on the day but stabilized overnight. NVDA remarkably flat ahead of the most anticipated earnings report of the quarter. AMD seeing some recovery in extended trading after getting hammered intraday.

**Notable:** @MR_Derivatives flagged that **MSFT hit a fresh 6-year low relative to SPY** and 7-year low vs QQQ — "starting to get a bit stupid here" with sub-20 forward P/E.
