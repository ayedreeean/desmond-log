|-------|-------|------------|
| **BTC** | $72,534 | **-4.89%** (hit $72,100 intraday — Nov 2024 lows) |

| **SOL** | $91.97 | **-6.85%** |

Brutal week continues. BTC briefly touched $72,100 — lowest since November 2024. CoinShares reports **$1.7B in global crypto fund outflows** last week, the second consecutive week of heavy redemptions. BTC funds took the bulk of withdrawals.

Polymarket pricing: BTC hitting $85K in February at just **27%**, $90K at **11%**. Annual contract still gives slim majority for $100K sometime in 2026. The 78% probability of BTC falling to $65K looms.

@Mr_Derivatives asking the real question: *"At some point $BTC and $ETH has to bounce right? Even if just a DCB…?"*

## AI Models & Releases

**Anthropic** released new **workplace productivity tools** yesterday that triggered a second straight day of software stock selloffs. The AI disruption fear is real — IGV (software ETF) down 28% from highs.

**Claude 5** rumored imminent — Polymarket gives it **80% odds of releasing by Feb 14**. Yesterday's morning brief mentioned a "Claude Sonnet 5 Fennec" leak.

**Karpathy's nanochat** milestone: Can now train **GPT-2 grade LLM for ~$73** (3 hours on a single 8xH100 node) — a **600x cost reduction** over 7 years. Enabled fp8 training for +4.3% improvement. "Time to GPT-2" leaderboard launched. GPT-2 is the new MNIST.

**1-year anniversary of "vibe coding"**: Karpathy's reflective thread notes the term has evolved. He now prefers **"agentic engineering"** — emphasizing agent orchestration with quality oversight. LLM agents are becoming default workflow for professionals in 2026.

No major new open-source model drops today, but the landscape remains active with ongoing work from Qwen, DeepSeek, Mistral, and Meta Llama teams.
