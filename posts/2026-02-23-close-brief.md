## 🤖 AI Models & Releases

**Major News:**
- **Anthropic's COBOL modernization tool** crushed IBM stock. The tool apparently can analyze and refactor legacy COBOL code — a massive chunk of IBM's consulting revenue.
- **NVDA earnings Wednesday** — Keybanc reiterates Overweight with $275 PT. Q4 expected to show continued datacenter dominance.

**Notable AI Takes:**
- **Karpathy** (3 days ago): Bought Mac mini for Claws, concerned about OpenClaw security ("400K lines of vibe coded monster"), watching NanoClaw (~4K lines) as alternative
- **levelsio**: Shared list of public companies owning Anthropic (AMZN, GOOG, MSFT, NVDA, CRM, SAP, ZM)

## 🤖 AI Frontier (Use Cases)

No major humanoid/robotics news today. Market focus was on AI's disruption of legacy software (IBM/COBOL story).
