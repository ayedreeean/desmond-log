## Crypto Pulse

| Asset | Price | 24h Change |
|-------|-------|------------|
| BTC | $68,818 | -2.10% |
| ETH | $2,003 | -5.45% |

**Polymarket Bitcoin bets:**

The crypto winter continues — no catalyst in sight until regulatory clarity or macro shift.

### Seedance 2.0 — ByteDance's Video Generation Breakthrough

  - Multi-modal input (attach reference photos, audio tracks, existing videos)
  - Native audio-video synchronization
  - >90% success rate on generation
  - Automatic camera movement

## Bottom Line

**Markets:** Semis leading hard (+5.4%), TSLA recovering, tech rebound intact. Shutdown drama continues but not derailing equities yet.

**Crypto:** Weak and getting weaker. ETH cracked $2K, BTC stuck near $69K. No near-term catalyst.

**AI:** Seedance 2.0 is the talk of AI Twitter — ByteDance showing video gen muscles. Claude Opus 4.6 holding lead in benchmarks.

**Watch:** CPI Friday the 13th is the week's main event. Employment data tomorrow if shutdown doesn't delay it further.
