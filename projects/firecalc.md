## What It Does

FIREcalc is a comprehensive retirement planning calculator that uses **Monte Carlo simulation** to model 1,000 different market scenarios, giving you realistic probability ranges for your financial goals.

### Two Calculators

1. **Savings Calculator**
   - Estimate time to reach savings targets
   - View milestone projections (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)
   - Understand growth sources (contributions vs. returns)
   - Get optimistic, typical, and conservative estimates

2. **Retirement Calculator**
   - Project how long your savings will last
   - Calculate success probability for different withdrawal rates
   - Test the 4% rule and custom strategies
   - Account for taxes and inflation

## Technical Details

- **Historical Data**: S&P 500, Bloomberg Bond Index, CPI from 1975-2020
- **Simulation**: 1,000 Monte Carlo scenarios per calculation
- **Visualization**: Chart.js with interactive milestone markers
- **Sharing**: Stateless URL parameters for scenario links
- **PWA**: Installable as a mobile app

## The FIRE Movement

**FIRE** = Financial Independence, Retire Early

The core principle: save 50-70% of income aggressively, invest in index funds, and reach a portfolio that sustains your expenses indefinitely.

**The 4% Rule**: Withdraw 4% of your initial portfolio annually (inflation-adjusted) with high probability of lasting 30+ years. This means your "FIRE number" is roughly 25x your annual expenses.

Example: $40K/year expenses → $1M FIRE number
